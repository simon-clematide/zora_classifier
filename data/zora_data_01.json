For some approaches, such as temperature index models, downscaling to lower resolutions is straightforward. However a key issue when using these downscaled models is to assess the impact of scaling on model behaviour and results, including the associated uncertainties. We assess the impact of scaling on both a simple and an enhanced temperature index melt model from 100 m to 1, 5 and 10 km resolutions. Different sub-grid parameterization approaches are applied to both models across all resolutions and tested for their suitability against high-resolution reference data, with the aim of developing a robust, scalable and computationally undemanding parameterization. Results show patterns of over- and underestimation of potential melt rates for both models, with clear dependencies on scale, terrain roughness and variations of temperature thresholds, among other quantities.

Behaviours that facilitate successful escape are therefore under strong selection, but anti-predator skills often emerge gradually during an individual\u2019s early development. Using long-term data and acoustic recordings of alarm calls collected during natural predator encounters, we aimed to elucidate two largely unsolved issues in anti-predator ontogeny: (i) whether incorrect predator assignment is adaptively age-appropriate, given that vulnerability often change during development, or whether age-related differences reflect true mistakes made by immature individuals; and (ii) the extent to which the development of adult-like competence in alarm-call production and usage is simply a function of maturational processes or dependent upon experience. We found that young meerkats (Suricata suricatta) were less likely to give alarm calls than were adults, but alarmed more in response t\r\no non-threatening species compared to adults. However, stimuli that pose a greater threat to young than adults did not elicit more calling from young; this argues against age-related changes in vulnerability as the sole explanation for developmental changes in calling. Young in small groups, who were more likely to watch out for predators, alarmed more than less vigilant young in larger groups. Moreover, despite similarities in acoustic structure between alarm call types, calls appeared in the repertoire at different rates and those that were associated with frequently encountered predators were produced relatively early on.

The type I protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 8 is the only member of the human PRMT family that is localized at the cell membrane and its endogenous substrates have remained unknown as yet. Although PRMT8 was supposed to be expressed only in brain tissue, its presence in HEK 293 (T) cells could be demonstrated. We identified more than 20 PRMT8-binding partners in pull-down experiments using recombinant PRMT8 as bait followed by mass spectrometric identification of the bound proteins. Among the extracted proteins were several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP), RNA-helicases (DEAD box proteins), the TET-family proteins TLS, Ewing's sarcoma (EWS), and TAF(II)68, and caprin, which all contain RGG methylation motifs and are potential substrates of PRMT8. Additionally, actin, tubulin, and heat shock proteins belong to the identified proteins. The interaction between PRMT8 and the EWS protein was characterized in more detail. Although binding of endogenous and recombinant EWS protein to PRMT8 as well as colocalization in HEK cells was observed, in vitro methylation assays revealed a rather poor methyltransferase activity of PRMT8 towards the EWS protein and a synthetic RGG-rich reference peptide (K(m), 1.3 muM; k(cat)/K(m), 2.8 x 10(-4) muM(-1) s(-1)) in comparison to PRMT1 (K(m), 0.8 muM; k(cat)/K(m), 8.1 x 10(-3) muM(-1) s(-1)). In contrast, substrate proteins within a cell extract could be methylated by PRMT8 as efficient as by PRMT1. The main interaction site of the EWS protein with PRMT8 was determined to be the C-terminal RGG box 3. Remarkably, complete methylation of the EWS protein did not abrogate the binding to PRMT8, pointing to an adapter role of PRMT8 for nuclear proteins at the cell membrane in addition to its methyltransferase activity.

The contrast in heat transfer between the atmosphere and the ground caused by thermally driven convection in winter and stable stratification of interstitial air during summer is usually invoked to explain this \u201cthermal diode\u201d effect. Based on measurements and model calculations, we propose an additional cooling mechanism, which is independent of convection, and solely functions based on the interplay of a winter snow cover and a layer of coarse blocks with low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of a block layer with a porosity of 0.4 is reduced by about an order of magnitude compared to solid rock. We use a simple and purely conductive model experiment to demonstrate that low-conductivity layers reduce the temperature below the winter snow cover as well as mean annual ground temperatures by comparison with other ground materials.

Demographic data can be obtained by direct monitoring or by analysing data of historical and recent collections. Although these methods provide the most detailed information they are very time consuming. Another alternative way is to make use of the information accumulated in the species' DNA over its history. Recent development of the coalescent theory makes it possible to reconstruct the demographic history of species using nucleotide polymorphism data. To separate the effect of natural selection and demography, multilocus analysis is needed because these two forces can produce similar patterns of polymorphisms. In this study we investigated the amount and pattern of sequence variability of a Europe wide sample set of two peat moss species (Sphagnum fimbriatum and S. squarrosum) with similar distributions and mating systems but presumably contrasting historical demographies using 3 regions of the nuclear genome (appr. 3000 bps). We aimed to draw inferences concerning demographic, and phylogeographic histories of the species.\r\nResults: All three nuclear regions supported the presence of an Atlantic and Non-Atlantic clade of S. fimbriatum suggesting glacial survival of the species along the Atlantic coast of Europe. Contrarily, S. squarrosum haplotypes showed three clades but no geographic structure at all. Maximum likelihood, mismatch and Bayesian analyses supported a severe historical bottleneck and a relatively recent demographic expansion of the Non-Atlantic clade of S. fimbriatum, whereas size of S. squarrosum populations has probably decreased in the past. Species wide molecular diversity of the two species was nearly the same with an excess of replacement mutations in S. fimbriatum. Similar levels of molecular diversity, contrasting phylogeographic patterns and excess of replacement mutations in S. fimbriatum compared to S. squarrosum mirror unexpected differences in the demography and population history of the species.\r\nConclusion: This study represents the first detailed European wide phylodemographic investigation on bryophytes and shows how pattern of nucleotide polymorphism can reveal unexpected differences in the population history of haploid plants with seemingly similar characteristics."], "publisher": ["BioMed Central"], "date": ["2007"], "source": ["Sz\u00f6v\u00e9nyi, P; Hock, Z; Schneller, J; T\u00f3th, Z  (2007).

What effect a reduction in the dietary phosphate intake has on intestinal phosphate absorption in CRF in vivo is unclear. In this study, we have used the in situ intestine loop technique to determine intestinal phosphate absorption in the 5/6-nephrectomy rat model of CRF under conditions of normal and restricted dietary phosphate intake. In this model of renal disease, we found that there is no significant change in the phosphate absorption in either the duodenum or jejunum regardless of the dietary phosphate intake. There was also no change in the expression of the messenger RNA of the major intestinal phosphate carrier the sodium-dependent-IIb transporter. Furthermore, we found no change in the intestinal villus length or in the location of phosphate uptake along the villus.

Previous studies have shown that PiT-1 and PiT-2 mediate electrogenic P(i) cotransport when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but only limited kinetic characterizations were made. To address this shortcoming, we performed a detailed analysis of SLC20 transport function. Three SLC20 clones (Xenopus PiT-1, human PiT-1, and human PiT-2) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Each clone gave robust Na(+)-dependent (32)P(i) uptake, but only Xenopus PiT-1 showed sufficient activity for complete kinetic characterization by using two-electrode voltage clamp and radionuclide uptake. Transport activity was also documented with Li(+) substituted for Na(+). The dependence of the P(i)-induced current on P(i) concentration was Michaelian, and the dependence on Na(+) concentration indicated weak cooperativity. The dependence on external pH was unique: the apparent P(i) affinity constant showed a minimum in the pH range 6.2-6.8 of approximately 0.05 mM and increased to approximately 0.2 mM at pH 5.0 and pH 8.0. Xenopus PiT-1 stoichiometry was determined by dual (22)Na-(32)P(i) uptake and suggested a 2:1 Na(+):P(i) stoichiometry. A correlation of (32)P(i) uptake and net charge movement indicated one charge translocation per P(i). Changes in oocyte surface pH were consistent with transport of monovalent P(i). On the basis of the kinetics of substrate interdependence, we propose an ordered binding scheme of Na(+):H(2)PO(4)(-):Na(+).

METHODS: Gene expression of ML3000 treated and untreated rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts were measured with Affymetrix gene arrays. Downregulation of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 was verified with Real-time polymerase chain reaction, CXCL10 protein levels were determined with ELISA. Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts were treated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor naproxen, the 5-LO inhibitor BWA4C and the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor MK886, and consecutive changes in CXCL10 protein levels measured. 5-LO expression was determined by polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. RESULTS: In synovial fibroblasts and monocyte-derived macrophages ML3000 inhibited the tumour necrosis factor induced expression of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, which are all ligands of the chemokine receptor CXCR3. No effect was observed in monocytes. Whereas inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway or the FLAP protein showed no effect, blockade of 5-LO significantly downregulated CXCL10 protein levels. 5-LO mRNA was detected in monocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages.

In this study we investigated the expression, regulation, and function of miR-155 and miR-146a in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and RA synovial tissue. METHODS: Locked nucleic acid microarray was used to screen for differentially expressed miRNA in RASFs treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TaqMan-based real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to measure the levels of miR-155 and miR-146a. Enforced overexpression of miR-155 was used to investigate the function of miR-155 in RASFs. RESULTS: Microarray analysis of miRNA expressed in RASFs treated with TNFalpha revealed a prominent up-regulation of miR-155. Constitutive expression of both miR-155 and miR-146a was higher in RASFs than in those from patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and expression of miR-155 could be further induced by TNFalpha, interleukin-1beta, lipopolysaccharide, poly(I-C), and bacterial lipoprotein. The expression of miR-155 in RA synovial tissue was higher than in OA synovial tissue. Enforced expression of miR-155 in RASFs was found to repress the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) and reduce the induction of MMPs 3 and 1 by Toll-like receptor ligands and cytokines. Moreover, compared with monocytes from RA peripheral blood, RA synovial fluid monocytes displayed higher levels of miR-155. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first description of increased expression of miRNA miR-155 and miR-146a in RA.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven patients with rheumatoid arthritis were included in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study to receive ramipril in an uptitration design (2.5 to 10 mg) for 8 weeks followed by placebo, or vice versa, on top of standard antiinflammatory therapy. Endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and disease activity were investigated at baseline and after each treatment period. Endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation increased from 2.85+/-1.49% to 4.00+/-1.81% (P=0.017) after 8 weeks of therapy with ramipril but did not change with placebo (from 2.85+/-1.49% to 2.84+/-2.47%; P=0.88).

However, previous studies on IL-23 expression in human tissues were based on p19 only. We aimed to study the expression and regulation of both IL-23 subunits, p19 and p40, in RA compared to osteoarthritis (OA) patients. METHODS: The expression of p19 and p40 in synovial tissues was analyzed by in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. IL-23 in RA and OA synovial fluids and sera was determined by ELISA. TLR-dependent induction of p19, p40 and bioactive IL-23 was determined in RASF, monocytes and MDDC by RT-PCR, Real-time PCR, Western-blot and functional-assays. RESULTS: The p19 subunit was abundantly expressed in RA but not in OA synovial tissues. p19 was most prominently expressed by RASF in the synovial lining layer and at the site of invasion, but no heterodimeric IL-23 was detected at these sites. Correspondingly, soluble IL-23 was not detectable or found at very low levels in synovial fluids and sera of patients with RA. By in-vitro experiments, we confirmed that TLR-activated RASF expressed p19 but not p40, in contrast to monocytes, which produced IL-23 following TLR stimulation. CONCLUSION: The TLR-dependent induction of p19 but not p40 in RASF and the abundant expression of p19 along with the low or undetectable levels of IL-23 in RA patients, gives strong evidence that p19 does not necessarily indicate the presence of IL-23 as it has been proposed so far."], "publisher": ["BMJ Publishing Group"], "date": ["2009"], "source": ["Brentano, F; Ospelt, C; Stanczyk, J; Gay, R E; Gay, S; Kyburz, D  (2009).

As the production of viruses coding for bioactive proteins is cost- and time-intensive, we established an in vivo long-term release model using osmotic minipumps in the SCID mouse model for RA. METHODS: Isolated RASF were cultured for 4 passages and coimplanted together with human cartilage and an Alzet(R) Osmotic Miniature Pump Model 2004 containing 200 microl of IL-10 and IL-1ra for 40 days in SCID mice. Implants were removed after 40 days and evaluated histologically. The actual rates of IL-10 and IL-1ra in murine serum were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Release of IL-10 and IL-1ra by the pumps was effective as both could be measured in significant amounts in the serum of the mice.

Renal scarring correlated with the extent of the acute-phase lesion (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and the grade of vesico-ureteric reflux (r = 0.31, p = 0.03), and was more frequent in refluxing renal units (p = 0.04). The majority of patients, i.e. 44 in the oral group and 47 in the intravenous/oral group, were managed as out-patients. Side effects were not observed. From this study, we can conclude that once-daily oral ceftibuten for 14 days yielded comparable results to sequential ceftriaxone/ceftibuten treatment in children aged 6 months to 16 years with DMSA-documented acute pyelonephritis and it allowed out-patient management in the majority of these children."], "publisher": ["Springer"], "date": ["2008"], "source": ["Neuhaus, T J; Berger, C; Buechner, K; Parvex, P; Bischoff, G; Goetschel, P; Husarik, D; Willi, U; Molinari, L; Rudin, C; Gervaix, A; Hunziker, U; Stocker, S; Girardin, E; Nadal, D  (2008).

The list of clinical manifestations and affected tissues in cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) such as nephronophthisis is broad and has been attributed to the wide expression pattern of ciliary proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to this dramatic diversity of phenotypes. We recently reported hypomorphic NPHP3 mutations in children and young adults with isolated nephronophthisis and associated hepatic fibrosis or tapetoretinal degeneration. Here, we chose a combinatorial approach in mice and humans to define the phenotypic spectrum of NPHP3/Nphp3 mutations and the role of the nephrocystin-3 protein. We demonstrate that the pcy mutation generates a hypomorphic Nphp3 allele that is responsible for the cystic kidney disease phenotype, whereas complete loss of Nphp3 function results in situs inversus, congenital heart defects, and embryonic lethality in mice. In humans, we show that NPHP3 mutations can cause a broad clinical spectrum of early embryonic patterning defects comprising situs inversus, polydactyly, central nervous system malformations, structural heart defects, preauricular fistulas, and a wide range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). On the functional level, we show that nephrocystin-3 directly interacts with inversin and can inhibit like inversin canonical Wnt signaling, whereas nephrocystin-3 deficiency leads in Xenopus laevis to typical planar cell polarity defects, suggesting a role in the control of canonical and noncanonical (planar cell polarity) Wnt signaling."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["2008"], "source": ["Bergmann, C; Fliegauf, M; Br\u00fcchle, N O; et al; Lienkamp, Soeren Sten  (2008).

This triple-fluorescent recombinant, rHSV-RYC, was replication competent, albeit with delayed kinetics, incorporated the fusion proteins into all three virion compartments, and was comparable to wild-type HSV-1 at the ultrastructural level. The VP26 capsid fusion protein (monomeric red fluorescent protein [mRFP]-VP26) was first observed throughout the nucleus and later accumulated in viral replication compartments. In the course of infection, mRFP-VP26 formed small foci in the periphery of the replication compartments that expanded and coalesced over time into much larger foci. The envelope glycoprotein H (gH) fusion protein (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein [EYFP]-gH) was first observed accumulating in a vesicular pattern in the cytoplasm and was then incorporated primarily into the nuclear membrane. The VP16 tegument fusion protein (VP16-enhanced cyan fluorescent protein [ECFP]) was first observed in a diffuse nuclear pattern and then accumulated in viral replication compartments. In addition, it also formed small foci in the periphery of the replication compartments which, however, did not colocalize with the small mRFP-VP26 foci. Later, VP16-ECFP was redistributed out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it accumulated in vesicular foci and in perinuclear clusters reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. Late in infection, mRFP-VP26, EYFP-gH, and VP16-ECFP were found colocalizing in dots at the plasma membrane, possibly representing mature progeny virus. In summary, this study provides new insights into the dynamics of compartmentalization and interaction among capsid, tegument, and envelope proteins.

Comparative studies have, for example, revealed that small-seeded species have higher RGR, leading to the common belief that small-seeded species possess physiological adaptations for rapid growth that would allow them to outgrow large-seeded species, given sufficient time. We show that, because RGR declines as individual plants grow, it is heavily biased by initial size and does not measure the size-corrected growth potential that determines the outcome of competition in the long term. We develop a daily growth model that includes a simple mechanistic representation of aboveground and belowground growth and its dependency on plant size and environmental factors. Intrinsic growth potential is encapsulated by the size-independent growth coefficient, G. We parameterized the model using repeated-harvest data from 1724 plants of nine species growing in contrasting nutrient and temperature regimes. Using information-theoretic criteria, we found evidence for interspecific differences in only three of nine model parameters: G, aboveground allocation, and frost damage. With other parameters shared between species, the model accurately reproduced above- and belowground biomass trajectories for all nine species in each set of environmental conditions. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the relationship between G and seed size was positive, despite a strong negative correlation between seed size and average RGR, meaning that large-seeded rather than small-seeded species have higher size-corrected growth potential. Further, we found a significant positive correlation between G and frost damage that, according to simulations, causes rank reversals in final biomass under daily temperature changes of \u00b15\u00b0C.

All vaccine substrains in use stem from one source, strain Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin. However, they differ in regions of genomic deletions, antigen expression levels, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy. RESULTS: As a RecA phenotype increases genetic stability and may contribute restricting the ongoing evolution of the various BCG substrains while maintaining their protective efficacy, we aimed to inactivate recA by allelic replacement in BCG vaccine strains representing different phylogenetic lineages (Pasteur, Frappier, Denmark, Russia). Homologous gene replacement was achieved successfully in three out of four strains. However, only illegitimate recombination was observed in BCG substrain Russia. Sequence analyses of recA revealed that a single nucleotide insertion in the 5' part of recA led to a translational frameshift with an early stop codon making BCG Russia a natural recA mutant. At the protein level BCG Russia failed to express RecA. CONCLUSION: According to phylogenetic analyses BCG Russia is an ancient vaccine strain most closely related to the parental M. bovis.

Since their discovery in the 1960s liposomes were recognized as models to study biological membranes and as versatile DDS of both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules. Liposomes--nanosized unilamellar phospholipid bilayer vesicles--undoubtedly represent the most extensively studied and advanced drug delivery vehicles. After a long period of research and development efforts, liposome-formulated drugs have now entered the clinics to treat cancer and systemic or local fungal infections, mainly because they are biologically inert and biocompatible and practically do not cause unwanted toxic or antigenic reactions. A novel, up-coming and promising therapy approach for the treatment of solid tumors is the depletion of macrophages, particularly tumor associated macrophages with bisphosphonate-containing liposomes. In the advent of the use of genetic material as therapeutic molecules the development of delivery systems to target such novel drug molecules to cells or to target organs becomes increasingly important.

Macrophages were depleted by the intraperitoneal injection of clodronate liposome (2 mg) 2 days before bone implantation and re-injection every 3 days (1 mg) until the sacrifice of the mice. Mice without clodronate liposome therapy or treated with empty liposome as well as mice injected with saline alone were included in this study as controls. Pouch tissues were collected 14 days after bone implantation for molecular and histology analysis. Our findings indicated that (1) macrophage depletion in clodronate-liposome-treated mice was achieved, as illustrated by F4/80 immunostaining in both pouch and spleen tissues; (2) clodronate-liposome treatment significantly reduced UHMWPE-induced tissue inflammation, with diminished pouch membrane thickness, reduced inflammatory cellular infiltration, and lowered interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) expression; (3) clodronate-liposome treatment markedly reduced the number of TRAP(+) cells in pouch tissues and protected against bone collagen depletion. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that macrophage depletion using clodronate-liposome reduces UHMWPE particle-induced inflammatory osteolysis.

Macrophages may influence healing by inducing the production of TGF-beta1 and PGE2 in different muscle cell types. We then found that the addition of TGF-beta1 induced PGE2 production in muscle cells, an effect probably mediated by COX-2 enzyme.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To examine the pharmacokinetics of liposomal m-THPC, we determined tissue and plasma variables in feline patients with spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In vivo fluorescence intensity measurements of tumor and skin were done with a fiber spectrophotometer after i.v. injection of m-THPC or liposomal m-THPC in 10 cats. Blood samples, drawn at several time points after photosensitizer administration, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: None of the liposomal m-THPC-treated cats showed side effects during or after drug injection. Fluorescence intensities, fluorescence ratios (tumor fluorescence divided by skin fluorescence), and bioavailability in the tumor were 2 to 4 times higher with liposomal m-THPC compared with m-THPC. Liposomal m-THPC concentration in the tumor increased constantly to reach a maximum at 4 hours after injection. Plasma concentration and bioavailability were approximately 3 times higher with liposomal m-THPC compared with m-THPC measured at the time points of highest plasma concentration. The distribution half-life was shorter with liposomal m-THPC, resulting in maximal tumor accumulation up to 5.5 times earlier. Maximal tumor accumulation and maximal fluorescence ratio with liposomal m-THPC occurred at the same time point, indicating maximal selectivity. In both groups, all cats responded to therapy.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome in association with gastric aspiration carries a mortality of up to 30% and accounts for up to 20% of deaths associated with anesthesia. Although the clinical condition is well known, knowledge about the exact inflammatory mechanisms is still incomplete. This study was performed to define the role of alveolar macrophages in this inflammatory response. In addition, potentially modifying effects of intratracheally applied nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate were investigated. METHODS: Rat alveolar macrophages were depleted by intratracheal administration of clodronate liposomes, and lung injury was evaluated 6 h after instillation of 0.1N hydrochloric acid. In a second set of experiments, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was intratracheally instilled 3 h after hydrochloric acid application, and injury parameters were determined. RESULTS: Depletion of alveolar macrophages resulted in decreased production of inflammatory mediators in acid aspiration (23-80% reduction of messenger RNA or protein of inflammatory mediators; P < 0.05) and consequently also in diminished neutrophil recruitment (36% fewer neutrophils; P < 0.01). Treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was highly effective in decreasing neutrophil recruitment (66%; P < 0.01) and vascular permeability (80%; P < 0.001).

One way of overcoming these disadvantages is the incorporation of such drugs into the bilayer matrix of phospholipid liposomes. To this end, we chose the approach of chemical transformation of water-soluble nucleosides of known cytotoxic properties into lipophilic drugs or prodrugs. Due to their insolubility, we developed formulations that can be used for intravenous applications in which the lipophilic molecules are incorporated into lipid bilayer membranes of small liposomes. We chose 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) as a cytotoxic nucleoside, and we demonstrated that N(4)-acyl derivatives of ara-C were active in vivo in various murine tumor models as liposomal formulations. However, the protection against enzymatic deamination was only partially achieved and was insufficient for significant improvement of cytotoxic properties. Thus, we synthesized a new class of N(4)-alkyl-ara-C derivatives. The most effective derivative, N(4)-octadecyl-ara-C (NOAC), is highly lipophilic and extremely resistant toward deamination. NOAC exerts excellent antitumor activity after oral and parenteral therapy. The activity of NOAC against freshly explanted clonogenic cells from human tumors was determined and compared with conventional antitumor agents. NOAC was used in two liposomal preparations, a stable lyophilized and a freshly prepared liquid formulation. Both formulations inhibited tumor colony formation equally in a concentration-dependent fashion. At optimal conditions, liposomal NOAC had significantly better activity compared with the clinically used drugs cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, mitomycin C, and etoposide. Furthermore, in a hematopoietic stem cell assay, NOAC was less toxic than ara-C and doxorubicin by factors ranging from 2.5 to 200, indicating that this drug is well tolerated at high doses."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["2005"], "source": ["Schwendener, R; Schott, H  (2005).

Dazu wurden acht Kantone ausgew\u00e4hlt (Z\u00fcrich, Bern, Aargau, Schaffhausen, Luzern, Tessin, Waadt und Genf), welche die unterschiedlichen Ausgangsbedingungen f\u00fcr den Aufstieg der SVP repr\u00e4sentieren."], "publisher": ["NZZ-Verlag"], "date": ["2005"], "source": ["Kriesi, H; Lachat, R; Selb, P; Bornschier, Simon; Helbling, M  (2005).

Although globalisation is not at the origin of these parties\u2019 development, it is the catalyst for the cultural and economic forces which these parties mobilise. We may therefore expect the orientations of the right-wing populist parties\u2019 programmes to converge.

The structural opposition between globalization 'winners' and 'losers' is expected to constitute potentials for political mobilization within national political contexts, the mobilization of which is expected to give rise to two intimately related dynamics: the transformation of the basic structure of the national political space and the strategic repositioning of the political parties within the transforming space. The article presents several hypotheses with regard to these two dynamics and tests them empirically on the basis of new data concerning the supply side of electoral politics from six Western European countries (Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland). The results indicate that in all the countries, the new cleavage has become embedded into existing two-dimensional national political spaces, that the meaning of the original dimensions has been transformed, and that the configuration of the main parties has become triangular even in a country like France."], "publisher": ["Wiley-Blackwell"], "date": ["2005"], "source": ["Kriesi, H; Grande, E; Lachat, R; Dolezal, M; Bornschier, Simon; Frey, T  (2005).
