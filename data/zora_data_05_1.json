After this treatment the animal was presented to the Equine Clinic University of Zurich with a history of acute colic and advanced symptoms of shock. On the basis of the clinical signs and laboratory values, a diagnosis of combined drug induced coagulopathy was made. The horse was treated with the antidote Vitamine- K1 (0.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously). Eventually, the general condition of the animal worsened and it was therefore euthanized. Necropsy revealed profound,\r\nmultifocal hemorrhagic diathesis of the serosal surface of the viscera, as well as bleeding into the visceral cavities. This case shows that concurrent administration\r\nof phenprocoumone and phenylbutazone may lead to drug interactions that increase the anticoagulation effect of the coumarine-derivative. Simultaneous use of coumarine-derivatives and phenylbutazone is therefore contraindicated due to the higher risk of bleeding. A reasonable treatment of horses with anticoagulants requires regular monitoring with constant evaluation of coagulation status and special attention to potential drug interactions.\r\nKeywords: Horse, anticoagulants, phenprocoumon,\r\nphenylbutazone, drug interactions"], "publisher": ["Hans Huber"], "date": ["2008"], "source": ["Cohausz, O; M\u00fcntener, Cedric R; Trachsel, Dagmar S; Wimmershoff, J; Wehrli Eser, Meret  (2008).

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. ANIMALS: Consecutive clinical patients (n = 37) with CrCL-deficient stifles (n = 40). METHODS: The stifle joints were examined arthroscopically prior to TTA. Meniscal release was not performed if the medial meniscus was intact. Open medial arthrotomy and partial meniscectomy were performed in the presence of meniscal tears. Vertical ground reaction forces were measured preoperatively and at follow-up examinations four to 16 months postoperatively (mean: 5.9 months). The ground reaction forces of a group of 65 healthy dogs were used for the comparison. The potential effects of clinical parameters on functional outcome were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: Complete CrCL rupture was identified in 28 joints, and partial CrCL rupture in 12 joints. The medial meniscus was damaged in 21 stifles. Vertical ground reaction forces were significantly higher at follow-up (P < 0.01), but remained significantly lower than those of control dogs (P < 0.01). Complications were identified in 25% of joints, and the dogs with complications had significantly lower peak vertical forces at follow-up than the dogs without complications (P = 0.04).

We found that, in the presence of both DNA and the alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2, a prototypical SR-protein), poly(ADP-ribose) affected topoisomerase I substrate selection and gradually shifted enzyme activity from protein phosphorylation to DNA cleavage. A likely mechanistic explanation was offered by the discovery that poly(ADP-ribose) forms a high affinity complex with ASF/SF2 thereby leaving topoisomerase I available for directing its action onto DNA. We identified two functionally important domains, RRM1 and RS, as specific poly(ADP-ribose) binding targets. Two independent lines of evidence emphasize the potential biological relevance of our findings: (i) in HeLa nuclear extracts, ASF/SF2, but not histone, phosphorylation was inhibited by poly(ADP-ribose); (ii) an in silico study based on gene expression profiling data revealed an increased incidence of alternative splicing within a subset of inflammatory response genes that are dysregulated in cells lacking a functional poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1.

Some of the chemicals involved, for example polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dibenzo-p-dioxins (dioxins), have received wide media attention because of their negative health impact on humans. The potential contribution of endocrine disruptors to the increased incidence of a number of diseases and developmental disorders in humans and animals is alarming, but the establishment of solid cause\u2212effect relationships requires further scientific investigation. In Switzerland, the necessity for a coordinated transdisciplinary approach to the environmental and public health problems caused by endocrine disruptors has now been widely recognized.

Because of overlapping histological features, it is impossible to distinguish ALCL from LyP on histological grounds. MUM1 (Multiple Myeloma oncogene 1) is expressed in systemic ALCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. MUM1 expression has not been studied in detail in CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders. OBJECTIVES: To examine the expression of MUM1 in CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders and to assess its value as a diagnostic marker. METHODS: Thirty-one formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of LyP (n = 15), primary cutaneous ALCL (n = 10), secondary cutaneous infiltrates of systemic ALCL (n = 4) and secondary cutaneous Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2) were analysed by immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against MUM1. RESULTS: Positive staining for MUM1 was observed in 13 cases of LyP (87%), two cases of primary cutaneous ALCL (20%), four cases of secondary cutaneous ALCL (100%) and two cases of secondary cutaneous Hodgkin lymphoma (100%). In 11 of 13 LyP cases (85%), MUM1 was displayed by the majority, i.e. 50-90%, of the tumour cells. In contrast to LyP and secondary cutaneous ALCL, only two cases of primary cutaneous ALCL (20%) harboured MUM1-positive tumour cells. There was a statistically significant difference in the expression of MUM1 between LyP and primary cutaneous ALCL (P = 0.002) and between primary cutaneous ALCL and secondary cutaneous ALCL (P = 0.015).

The goats receiving anionic salts had greater CTX concentrations throughout the administration of the salts. In sheep, a difference was only observed on the day of parturition. Similar observations were made in VITD concentrations, although a significant difference between the goat groups was only observed 3 d prepartum. The bone formation marker osteocalcin was lower prepartum in the animals supplemented with anionic salts. The urinary pH was lower in the SA and GA animals, whereas urinary Ca concentrations were greater. Bone mineral content and bone mineral density decreased in all groups around parturition. In conclusion, this experiment showed that the addition of anionic salts in goats led to greater bone resorption rates while on this feeding regimen. It can be concluded that the anionic salts induced a mild metabolic acidosis with all its effects on calcium metabolism.

Notably, endogenous VEGF signalling during insult was essential for cell fate since VEGF inhibition appreciably augmented cell death and reduced proliferation.

In particular, as the quality of forage declines with increasing contents of plant fibre (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin; measured as neutral-detergent fibre, NDF), the tubiform foregut of kangaroos may allow these animals to maintain food intakes more so than ruminants like sheep, which appear to be limited by fibrous bulk filling the foregut and truncating further ingestion. Using available data on dry matter intake (DMI, g kg\u2212 0.75 d\u2212 1), ingesta mean retention time (MRT, h), and apparent digestibility, we modelled digestible dry matter intake (DDMI) and digestible energy intake (DEI) by ruminant sheep (Ovis aries) and by the largest marsupial herbivore, the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus). Sheep achieved higher MRTs on similar DMIs, and hence sheep achieved higher DDMIs for any given level of DMI as compared with kangaroos. Interestingly, MRT declined in response to increasing DMI in a similar pattern for both species, and the association between DMI and plant NDF contents did not support the hypothesis that kangaroos are less affected by increasing fibre relative to sheep. However, when DEI was modelled according to DDMIs and dietary energy contents, we show that the kangaroos could meet their daily maintenance energy requirements (MER) at lower levels of DMI and on diets with higher fibre contents compared with sheep, due largely to the kangaroos' lower absolute maintenance and basal energy metabolisms compared with eutherians.

Compared to their free-ranging counterparts, captive specimens seemed to have a lower polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) status, and in particular a lower omega(n)3/n6 PUFA ratio. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the available data on free-ranging and captive wild animals was missing so far. We collated data on the FA status of free-ranging and captive wild animals, comparing only data for the same body tissues and lipid fractions. In general, zoo-kept wild animals had a lower n3/n6 PUFA status; in particular, birds and mammalian herbivore species for which data were available consistently showed lower proportions of n3 PUFA and total PUFA in captivity. In zoo animals, this discrepancy has been repeatedly suspected to contribute to clinical problems, although conclusive studies are lacking. Should an adjustment of the FA status in captivity to the one in the wild be an objective in the dietary management of zoo animals, several strategies could be adopted: the feeding of horse or rabbit instead of ruminant meat; the use of food insects that are raised on green produce instead of grain products; the feeding of marine non-vertebrates such as shrimp or squid to animals specialized on these items but conventionally fed fish. In particular, a higher proportion of forage in general, the use of fresh or ensilaged forage instead of hay, a reduction of the use of grain-based concentrates, and an increased use of forage products (grass or lucerne meal) and linseed products in pelleted feeds, are measures that have been demonstrated in domestic herbivores to increase the n3/n6 PUFA status."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["2007"], "source": ["Clauss, Marcus; Grum, C; Hatt, Jean-Michel  (2007).

Key steps in the PYP photocycle are the isomerization and protonation of its chromophore, p-coumaric acid (pCA). In the ground state of the protein, this chromophore is in the trans configuration with its phenolic oxygen deprotonated. For this paper, we studied four different configurations of pCA solvated in water with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations as implemented in CP2K/Quickstep. We researched the influence of the protonation and isomerization state of pCA on its hydrogen-bonding properties and on the Mulliken charges of the atoms in the simulation. The chromophore isomerization state influenced the hydrogen-bonding less than its protonation state. In general, more charge yielded a higher hydrogen-bond coordination number. Where deprotonation increases both the coordination number and the residence time of the water, molecules around the chromophore, protonation showed a somewhat lower coordination number on two of the three pCA oxygens but much higher residence times on all of them. This could be explained by the increased polarization of the OH groups of the molecule. The presence of the chromophore also influenced the charge and polarization of the water molecules around it. This effect was different in the four systems studied and mainly localized in the first solvation shell. We also performed a proton-transfer reaction from hydronium through various other water molecules to the chromophore. In this small charge-separated system, the protonation occurred within 6.5 ps.

The present study reanalyzes data aimed at identifying the set of items best suited for measuring gelotophobia and estimates the prevalence of gelotophobia in the four groups (N = 863). The application of several criteria led to a final list of 15 statements. Cut-off points for a slight, pronounced, and extreme expression of gelotophobia were defined. In the group of those clinically assessed as having gelotophobia, the cut-off points were exceeded by approximately 31%, 39%, and 22%, respectively. Only 7.1% did not exceed the cut-off point, suggesting that the self-report measure validly determines the presence of and measures the intensity of gelotophobia.

All tracked elephants displayed similar ranging patterns. The observed home ranges were small (mean=115.2\u00b164.0 km2) relative to reported home ranges in India, possibly in response to high habitat productivity and abundant perennial water sources. Elephants showed high fidelity to their ranges. Home ranges had relatively large core areas, suggesting intensive use of habitat. No geographically distinct seasonal ranges or migratory behavior was observed. Home range overlap was high, and territoriality was absent. Male musth ranges were considerably larger than non-musth ranges and may signify mate searching. Most elephants ranged both in and outside protected areas, suggesting that resources outside protected areas were important for their survival. Thus, translocating and restricting elephants to protected areas will be detrimental to their survival, as it limits resource access. The ranging patterns of Asian elephants suggest that conservation of the species requires their management both in and outside protected areas.\r\n\r\nZusammenfassung - Mittels VHF Telemetrie untersuchten wir die Streifgebiete von 10 Elefanten in und um den Yala Nationalpark im S\u00fcden Sri Lankas. Alle besenderten Elefanten zeigten \u00e4hnliche Bewegungsmuster. Im Vergleich zu Indien waren die beobachteten Reviere in Sri Lanka relativ klein (115.2\u00b164.0 km2). Dies ist vermutlich eine Folge der hohen Habitatsproduktivit\u00e4t und der ganzj\u00e4hrigen Verf\u00fcgbarkeit von Wasser in Sri Lanka. Die Elefanten zeigten sich ihrem Revier sehr treu. Die Streifgebiete hatten relativ grosse Aktivit\u00e4tszentren, was auf eine intensive Nutzung des Habitats hindeutet. Es wurden weder geografisch unterschiedliche saisonale Reviere noch Migrationen beobachtet. Die \u00dcberlappung der Reviere war gross, und Territorialit\u00e4t war nicht vorhanden. Die Steifgebiete der M\u00e4nnchen in Musth waren deutlich gr\u00f6sser als die Gebiete ausserhalb der Musth. Die Ursache daf\u00fcr k\u00f6nnte die Suche nach einem paarungsbereiten Weibchen sein. Die meisten Elefanten hielten sich sowohl innerhalb als auch ausserhalb des Yala Nationalparks auf, was darauf hinweist, dass die Gebiete ausserhalb des Parks f\u00fcr ihr \u00dcberleben wichtig sind. Demzufolge gef\u00e4hrden Umsiedlungen und Restriktion auf die Naturschutzgebiete das \u00dcberleben der Elefanten, da der Zugang zu den Ressourcen ausserhalb des Parks verwehrt wird. Die Bewegungsmuster der Elefanten deuten darauf hin, dass zur Arterhaltung Gebiete innerhalb und ausserhalb der Nationalparks ber\u00fccksichtigt werden m\u00fcssen."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["2008"], "source": ["Fernando, P; Wikramanayake, Eric D; Janaka, H K; Jayasinghe, L K A; Gunawardena, M; Kotagama, S W; Weerakoon, D; Pastorini, Jennifer  (2008).
