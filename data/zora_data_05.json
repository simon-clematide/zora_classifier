Conventional yeast two-hybrid screens have been used to probe protein-protein interactions of these soluble C termini. However, to date no in vivo technology has been available to study interactions between the full-length integral membrane proteins and their cognate PDZ-interacting partners. We previously developed a split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) system to test interactions between such integral membrane proteins by using a transcriptional output based on cleavage of a transcription factor from the C terminus of membrane-inserted baits. Here we modified MYTH to permit detection of C-terminal PDZ domain interactions by redirecting the transcription factor moiety from the C to the N terminus of a given integral membrane protein thus liberating their native C termini. We successfully applied this \"MYTH 2.0\" system to five different mammalian full-length renal transporters and identified novel PDZ domain-containing partners of the phosphate (NaPi-IIa) and sulfate (NaS1) transporters that would have otherwise not been detectable. Furthermore this assay was applied to locate the PDZ-binding domain on the NaS1 protein. We showed that the PDZ-binding domain for PDZK1 on NaS1 is upstream of its C terminus, whereas the two interacting proteins, NHERF-1 and NHERF-2, bind at a location closer to the N terminus of NaS1. Moreover NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 increased functional sulfate uptake in Xenopus oocytes when co-expressed with NaS1. Finally we used MYTH 2.0 to demonstrate that the NaPi-IIa transporter homodimerizes via protein-protein interactions within the lipid bilayer.

Well informed and educated patients ideally manage to prevent or delay the onset of severe chronic diseases. With respect to erectile dysfunction (ED) this is of importance because ED is considered to herald debilitating cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease. Aim. This survey aimed to assess patient's knowledge about risk factors (RF) for ED and to identify their preferred source of information. Main Outcome Measures. Knowledge of RF for ED and sources used to gather information about ED as reported by patients with ED. Methods. Between July 2004 and June 2006, 126 patients who presented at our outpatient clinic for an assessment of their ED were prospectively evaluated. The patients received a questionnaire about their demographic and socioeconomic circumstances, their strategies to gather information about ED, and their knowledge of specific RF for this disease. The questionnaire was completed by 81 patients (64%). Results. Forty-one patients (51%) could not name one single RF for ED. Three men knew more than three RF. The two most popular sources of information were the Internet and general practitioners. Well-educated patients were significantly better informed than others. Patients using the Internet as source for health information were significantly younger and had a better knowledge about RF for ED compared to those not using the Internet. Conclusions. Patients' knowledge about RF for ED is poor. The Internet seems to be the most useful information source for patients with ED and is predominantly used by younger and better educated patients.

This Review outlines the mechanisms involved in the development of glomerulosclerosis-particularly those responsible for podocyte injury-with an emphasis on the potential capacity of endothelin receptor blockade to reverse this process. There is strong evidence that endothelin-1, a peptide with growth-promoting and vasoconstricting properties, has a central role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, which is mediated via activation of the ET(A) receptor. Several antiproteinuric drugs, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, statins and certain calcium channel blockers, inhibit the formation of endothelin-1.

METHODS: Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, estrogen receptor function, and hormone therapy are reviewed, with particular emphasis on clinical and molecular issues. RESULTS: Whether hormone therapy can improve cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women remains controversial. Current evidence suggests that the vascular effects of estrogen are affected by the stage of reproductive life, the time since menopause, and the extent of subclinical atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of vascular responsiveness to sex steroids during different stages of atherosclerosis development remain poorly understood in women and men. CONCLUSION: In view of the expected increase in the prevalence of atherosclerotic vascular disease worldwide due to population aging, research is needed to determine the vascular mechanism of endogenous and exogenous sex steroids in patients with atherosclerosis.

In the carotid, but not in femoral artery, ROS/.OH-induced dilation increased with increasing dietary fat intake (P < 0.05 vs. LF diet), while contractile responses to ROS/.OH remained unaffected. In femoral arteries, ROS/.OH-induced contractions were reversed into relaxations after both HF and VHF diet (P < 0.05 vs. LF diet). Both ET-1 and Ang II induced strong contractions in the femoral artery that were unaffected by dietary fat intake.

In this context, whether ET-1 modulates hydroxyl radical (*OH) formation and the function of ROS/*OH in obesity is not known. In the present study, formation and function of ROS, including *OH, were investigated in the aorta of lean and leptin-deficient obese ob/ob mice. Hydroxyl radical formation was detected ex vivo using terephthalic acid in intact aortic rings and the involvement of ROS in ET-1-mediated vasoreactivity was analyzed using the antioxidant EPC-K1, a combination of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. Generation of either *OH, *O(2)(-), and H(2)O(2) was strongly inhibited by EPC-K1 (all P < 0.05). In obese mice, basal vascular *OH formation and ROS activity were reduced by 3-fold and 5-fold, respectively (P < 0.05 vs. lean). ET-1 markedly enhanced *OH formation in lean (6-fold, P < 0.05 vs. untreated) but not in obese mice. Obesity increased ET-1-induced contractions (P < 0.05 vs. lean), and ROS scavenging further enhanced the response (P < 0.05 vs. untreated). Exogenous ROS, including *OH caused stronger vasodilation in obese animals (P < 0.05 vs. lean), whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation was similar between lean and obese animals. In conclusion, we present a sensitive method allowing ex vivo measurement of vascular *OH generation and provide evidence that ET-1 regulates vascular *OH formation. The data indicate that in obesity, vascular formation of ROS, including *OH is lower, whereas the sensitivity to ROS is increased, suggesting a novel and important role of ROS, including *OH in the regulation of vascular tone in disease status associated with increased body weight."], "publisher": ["American Physiological Society"], "date": ["2007-12"], "source": ["Mundy, A L; Haas, E; Bhattacharya, I; Widmer, C C; Kretz, M; Baumann, K; Barton, M  (2007).

The barbiturate phenobarbital (PB)isoneofthebest studied examples of a drug that potently induces cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and other genes in the liver. The mechanisms that control the induction of detoxifying genes and the receptors recognizing those have remained elusive for many years. This changed in 1998 when the pregnane X receptor [PXR, alternatively called pregnane activated receptor (PAR) or steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR); NR1I2] and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, alternatively called constitutive active receptor; NR1I3) were discovered to play a role in xenobiotic mediated induction of CYPs. It turned out that PXR and CAR could accommodate all the conundrums associated with induction of CYPs by xenobiotics. First, due to an\r\nunusually flexible ligand-binding domain (LBD), PXR and CAR\r\nare promiscuous towards many structurally diverse\r\ncompounds. Second, as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR; NR2B1, 2 and 3), PXR and CAR are able to bind to different DNA-binding elements and thus directly activate many genes involved in drug detoxification and excretion. Third, the LBDs of PXR and CAR orthologs are unusually divergent between species, and therefore are activated by different chemicals in a very species-specific manner. A number of review articles provide an up-to-date description of the basic functions of PXR and CAR. This chapter is focused on the recent advances in the\r\ncharacterization of PXR and CAR.

The central feature of this activation process is the occupation of an antibonding pi{*} orbital upon electronic excitation from the singlet ground state S-0 to the first excited singlet state S-1. Populating the antibonding LUMO weakens the triple bond of dinitrogen. After a vertical excitation, the excited complex may structurally relax in the S-1 state and approaches its minimum structure in the S-1 state. This excited-state minimum structure features the dinitrogen bound in a diazenoid form, which exhibits a double bond and two lone pairs localized at the two nitrogen atoms, ready to be protonated. Reduction and de-excitation then yield the corresponding diazene complex; its generation represents the essential step in a nitrogen fixation and reduction protocol. The consecutive process of excitation, protonation, and reduction may be rearranged in any experimentally appropriate order. The protons needed for the reaction from dinitrogen to diazene can be provided by the ligand sphere of the complexes, which contains sulfur atoms acting as proton acceptors. These protonated thiolate functionalities bring protons close to the dinitrogen moiety. Because protonation does not change the pi{*}-antibonding character of the LUMO, the universal and well-directed character of the photochemical activation process makes it possible to protonate the dinitrogen complex before it is irradiated. The pi{*}-antibonding LUMO plays the central role in the activation process, since the diazenoid structure was obtained by excitation from various occupied orbitals as well as by a direct two-electron reduction (without photochemical activation) of the complex; that is, the important bending of N-2 towards a diazenoid conformation can be achieved by populating the pi{*}-antibonding LUMO."], "publisher": ["Wiley-Blackwell"], "date": ["2004-09"], "source": ["Reiher, M; Kirchner, B; Hutter, J; Sellmann, D; Hess, B A  (2004).

We propose a suitable formalism for computing transition intensities based on the modern theory of polarization, which is applicable to condensed-phase and finite systems alike. The gain in intensity brought about by thermal fluctuations is studied in molecular acetone at room temperature, and in gas-phase (CH3)(2)CO.(H2O)(2) at 25 K. The latter system is characterized by the appearance of relatively intense features in the low-energy region of the spectrum, attributable to spurious solvent-->solute charge-transfer excitations created by deficiencies in the DFT methodology. The n-->pi{*} transition can be partially isolated from the charge-transfer bands, yielding a blueshift of 0.17 eV with respect to gas-phase acetone. This analysis is then carried over to a solution of acetone in water, where further complications are encountered in the from of a solute-->solvent charge transfer excitations overlapping with the n-->pi{*} band. The optically active occupied states are found to be largely localized on either solute or solvent, and using this feature we were again able to isolate the physical n-->pi{*} band and compute the solvatochromic shift. The result of 0.19 eV is in good agreement with experiment, as is the general increase in the mean oscillator strength of the transition.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this multicentre study was to compare the efficacy of rosuvastatin with or without access to compliance initiatives, in bringing patients to the Joint European Task Force's (1998) recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level goal (LDL-C, <3.0 mmol/L) at week 24. Secondary objectives were comparison of the number and percentage of patients achieving European goals (1998, 2003) for LDL-C and other lipid parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia and a 10-year coronary heart disease risk of >20% received open label rosuvastatin treatment for 24 weeks with or without access to compliance enhancement tools. The initial daily dosage of 10 mg could be doubled at week 12. Compliance tools included: a) a starter pack for subjects containing a videotape, an educational leaflet, a passport/goal diary and details of the helpline and/or website; b) regular personalised letters to provide message reinforcement; c) a toll-free helpline and a website. RESULTS: The majority of patients (67%) achieved the 1998 European goal for LDL-C at week 24. 31% required an increase in dosage of rosuvastatin to 20 mg at week 12. Compliance enhancement tools did not increase the number of patients achieving either the 1998 or the 2003 European target for plasma lipids. Rosuvastatin was well tolerated during this study. The safety profile was comparable with other drugs of the same class. 63 patients in the 10 mg group and 58 in the 10 mg Plus group discontinued treatment. The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (39 patients in the 10 mg group; 35 patients in the 10 mg Plus group) and loss to follow-up (13 patients in the 10 mg group; 9 patients in the 10 mg Plus group). The two most frequently reported adverse events were myalgia (34 patients, 3% respectively) and back pain (23 patients, 2% respectively). The overall rate of temporary or permanent study discontinuation due to adverse events was 9% (n = 101) in patients receiving 10 mg rosuvastatin and 3% (n = 9) in patients titrated up to 20 mg rosuvastatin.

We compared the ACE inhibitor ramipril, the ARB telmisartan, and the combination of the two drugs in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes. METHODS: After a 3-week, single-blind run-in period, patients underwent double-blind randomization, with 8576 assigned to receive 10 mg of ramipril per day, 8542 assigned to receive 80 mg of telmisartan per day, and 8502 assigned to receive both drugs (combination therapy). The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: Mean blood pressure was lower in both the telmisartan group (a 0.9/0.6 mm Hg greater reduction) and the combination-therapy group (a 2.4/1.4 mm Hg greater reduction) than in the ramipril group. At a median follow-up of 56 months, the primary outcome had occurred in 1412 patients in the ramipril group (16.5%), as compared with 1423 patients in the telmisartan group (16.7%; relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.09).

Both mechanisms contribute to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Although acute supplementation of BH(4) improves endothelial dysfunction, the effect of chronic BH(4) in humans is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic BH(4) supplementation on endothelial function and oxidative stress in hypercholesterolaemia. DESIGN: Randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENTS: 22 hypercholesterolaemic patients (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) >4.5 mmol/l) were randomised to 4 weeks of oral BH(4) (400 mg twice daily) or placebo. Age-matched healthy volunteers served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. To elucidate the mechanisms of BH(4) effect, NO release and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production were measured in human aortic endothelial cells exposed to native LDL (2.6 mmol cholesterol/l). RESULTS: BH(4) plasma levels were significantly increased by oral supplementation. NO-mediated vasodilatation to acetylcholine was reduced in patients compared with controls and restored by BH(4). No effect of BH(4) on endothelium-independent vasodilatation was seen. Furthermore, 8-F(2 )isoprostane plasma levels, a marker of vascular oxidative stress, were reduced by BH(4). In LDL-treated endothelial cells, BH(4) levels and NO release were reduced and O(2)(-) production increased compared with control cells. Exogenous BH(4) normalised NO and O(2)(-) production. CONCLUSIONS: In hypercholesterolaemia, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress can be reversed by chronic oral treatment with BH(4).

Two Na(+)-dependent phosphate transporters, NaPi-IIa (Slc34a1) and NaPi-IIc (Slc34a3), are located in the brush border membrane (BBM) of the proximal tubule and mediate renal phosphate reabsorption. Transcriptome analysis of kidneys from acid-loaded mice revealed a large decrease in NaPi-IIc messenger RNA (mRNA) and a smaller reduction in NaPi-IIa mRNA abundance. To investigate the contribution of transporter regulation to phosphaturia during MA, we examined renal phosphate transporters in normal and Slc34a1-gene ablated (NaPi-IIa KO) mice acid-loaded for 2 and 7 days. In normal mice, urinary phosphate excretion was transiently increased after 2 days of acid loading, whereas no change was found in Slc34a1-/- mice. BBM Na/Pi cotransport activity was progressively and significantly decreased in acid-loaded KO mice, whereas in WT animals, a small increase after 2 days of treatment was seen. Acidosis increased BBM NaPi-IIa abundance in WT mice and NaPi-IIc abundance in WT and KO animals. mRNA abundance of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc decreased during MA. Immunohistochemistry did not indicate any change in the localization of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc along the nephron. Interestingly, mRNA abundance of both Slc20 phosphate transporters, Pit1 and Pit2, was elevated after 7 days of MA in normal and KO mice. These data demonstrate that phosphaturia during acidosis is not caused by reduced protein expression of the major Na/Pi cotransporters NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc and suggest a direct inhibitory effect of low pH mainly on NaPi-IIa.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the neural correlates underlying imagery generated from short- and long-term memory (STM and LTM).

We compare the three most genetically divergent groups of Darwin\u2019s finches comprising morphologically and ecologically similar allopatric populations: the cactus finches (Geospiza scandens and Geospiza conirostris), the sharp-beaked ground finches (Geospiza difficilis) and the\r\nwarbler finches (Certhidea olivacea and Certhidea fusca). Evidence of reduced genetic diversity due to drift was limited to warbler finches on small, peripheral islands. Evidence of low levels of recent interisland migration was widespread throughout all three groups. The hypothesis of distance-limited dispersal received the strongest support in cactus and sharp-beaked ground finches as evidenced by patterns of isolation by distance, while warbler finches showed a weaker relationship. Support for the hypothesis that gene flow constrains morphological divergence was only found in one of eight comparisons within these groups. Among warbler finches, genetic divergence was relatively high while phenotypic divergence was low, implicating stabilizing selection rather than constraint due to gene flow. We conclude that the adaptive radiation of Darwin\u2019s finches has occurred in the presence of ongoing but low levels of gene flow caused by distance-dependent interisland dispersal.

The extent to which recombination contributes to the diversity at MHC loci in natural populations is still controversial, and there have been only few comparative studies that make quantitative estimates of recombination rates. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis for 15 different ungulates species to estimate the population recombination rate, and to quantify levels of selection. As expected for all species, we observed signatures of strong positive selection, and identified individual residues experiencing selection that were congruent with those constituting the peptide-binding region of the human DRB gene. However, in addition for each species, we also observed recombination rates that were significantly different from zero on the basis of likelihood-permutation tests, and in other non-quantitative analyses. Patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous sequence diversity were consistent with differing demographic histories between species, but recent simulation studies by other authors suggest inference of selection and recombination is likely to be robust to such deviations from standard models.

The Spinal Cord Independence Measure II (SCIM II) is an independence scale that was specifically developed for subjects with SCI. However, little is known about the changes in SCIM II scores during and after rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate changes in functional recovery during the first year after a complete SCI as measured by the SCIM II compared with neurological recovery (motor scores according to the American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA]). METHODS: SCIM II data and ASIA motor scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after injury (derived from the database of the European Multicenter Study of Human Spinal Cord Injury) of 64 patients with complete paraplegia and 36 patients with complete quadriplegia were analyzed. RESULTS: In patients with complete paraplegia, the SCIM II total score improved significantly during the 1-year follow-up, even after discharge from rehabilitation. In contrast, the ASIA motor scores showed little recovery. In patients with quadriplegia, functional and motor recovery developed in parallel during rehabilitation and after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The SCIM II is responsive to functional changes in patients with a persistent motor complete SCI. It is clinically useful for monitoring functional improvement during rehabilitation and after discharge.

Nonetheless, decreasing efficiency of tissue vaporisation during the course of the operation and macroscopic alterations of the laser fibre's tip are regularly observed and seem to affect the outcome of this procedure. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the course of power output and to determine the type and extent of fibre deterioration during PVP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty laser fibres were investigated during PVP in 35 consecutive patients with prostatic bladder outflow obstruction between January 2007 and August 2007 in a university hospital. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent PVP performed by three different surgeons using the 80-W KTP laser. MEASUREMENTS: Power output was measured at the beginning and regularly throughout PVP and throughout in vitro vaporisation without fibre-tissue contact. Microscopic documentation of the fibre tip was performed after the procedure. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Carbonisation and melting of the fibre tip was regularly visible and appeared to be more pronounced as more energy was applied. Additionally, 90% of the fibres showed a significant decrease of power output during PVP, resulting in an end-of-lifespan (ie, 275-kilojoule) median power output of 20% of the initial value. Final median power output after in vitro vaporisation was 83% of the starting value. The extent of the structural and functional changes might only be valid for the operative technique performed in this investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Fibre deterioration caused significant reduction of power output during PVP.

Their importance can be assessed in the frequent depiction of gibbons in the figurative arts. This is the first study to quantify the production of gibbon paintings in various periods of these countries\u2019 history. A total of 818 gibbon paintings were surveyed. Results show that the earliest gibbon paintings are much older than suggested in some previous publications \u2013 both in China (pre-Song) and in Japan (pre- Momoyama). Moreover, because of the low sampling level of early Asian paintings, gibbon paintings as a genre in each of these countries may still have a much earlier origin than the date indicated by the earliest paintings found during this study. The genre originated in China and later spread to the neighbouring countries Japan and Korea, although artists had limited knowledge about the apes they painted because gibbons never naturally occurred in these countries. Chinese paintings depicted gibbons in a large number of functions and contexts, for instance as symbols of Daoist and Buddhist origin. In Japan, however, the genre was introduced by Zen (=Chan) monks, and the large majority of Japanese gibbon paintings depict the old Buddhist theme \u201cGibbons grasping for the reflection of the moon in the water\u201d. Stylistically, however, Chinese and Japanese gibbon paintings quickly drifted apart. The theme \u201cGibbons grasping for the reflection of the moon in the water\u201d is not depicted in Korean paintings, but the small sample of Korean gibbon paintings found during this study precludes generalizations. The production rate of gibbon paintings/time in China underwent marked, previously undocumented fluctuations. During the period from 1525 to 1900, gibbon paintings were continuously, but not frequently, being produced in China. To judge by the number of preserved gibbon paintings from that time, the genre was apparently more popular in Japan than in China. The most dramatic increase in the production rate of gibbon paintings occurred in China during the 20th century. Whereas gibbon paintings as a genre had almost completely been abandoned in Japan during that time, China experienced a previously undocumented and apparently unprecedented increase both in the number of painters that produced gibbon paintings, as well as in the high number of gibbon paintings that were produced by some specialists among these painters. Possible reasons for these fluctuations are discussed.

In the present paper, we investigate the relevance of each of these two theories for the degree of female dominance over males.

This paper seeks to resolve these difficulties by (1) proposing an overarching hypothesis that encompasses many of the previously proposed hypotheses; (2) testing the predictions of this hypothesis using rigorously compiled data and utilizing multiple methods of analysis.

These costs and benefits are directly reflected in the length of life history stages. We tested this hypothesis on a wide range of primate species. Our results demonstrate that encephalization is significantly correlated with prolongation of all stages of developmental life history except the lactational period, and is significantly correlated with an extension of the reproductive lifespan.

Independent of any retrieval techniques, the calculated AOD retrieval requirements are compared with the expected performance parameters of the upcoming hyperspectral sensor APEX at the reference wavelength of 550nm. The AOD accuracy requirements are defined to be capable of resolving transmittance differences of 0.01 to 0.04 according to the demands of atmospheric corrections for remote sensing applications. For the purposes of this analysis, the signal at the sensor level is simulated by radiation transfer equations. The resulting radiances are translated into the AOD retrieval sensitivity (\u0394\u03c4 aer \u03bb ) and compared to the available measuring sensitivity of the sensor (NE \u0394Lsensor \u03bb ). This is done for multiple signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and surface reflectance values. It is shown that an SNR of 100 is adequate for AOD retrieval at 550nm under typical remote sensing conditions and a surface reflectance of 10% or less. Such dark surfaces require the lowest SNR values and therefore offer the best sensitivity for measuring AOD. Brighter surfaces with up to 30% reflectance require an SNR of around 300. It is shown that AOD retrieval for targets above 50% surface reflectance is more problematic with the current sensor performance as it may require an SNR larger than 1000.

METHODS: First-derivative normalized spectra of dried films of bacterial growth on Que-Bact Universal Medium No. 2 were examined by singular value decomposition to identify key spectral regions. Region selection was analysed by principal component analysis (PCA), self-organizing maps (SOMs) and the K-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm. The initial data set included 35 GISA (including GISA Mu50 and heterogeneous GISA Mu3) and 25 epidemic MRSA. The regions were then tested using enlarged data sets that included 22 sporadic and 85 additional epidemic MRSA. RESULTS: Epidemic MRSA and GISA/hGISA were separated into two distinct clusters on the basis of spectral data from regions 1352-1315 and 1480-1460 cm(-1), the former providing 100% correct classification by all three analyses and the latter providing 96.67% correct by PCA, 98.34% by SOM and 100% by KNN. The 1480-1460 cm(-1) region was more effective for distinguishing GISA/hGISA from a set combining sporadic and epidemic MRSA, with two GISA/hGISA and four sporadic MRSA misclassified by PCA and SOM (92.69% correct), while the KNN method misclassified three of the four sporadic MRSA (93.90% correct). The addition of 85 other epidemic MRSA this set increased the fraction of correctly classified isolates to 96.41% and 97.01% by PCA, SOM and KNN, respectively.

Besides enhancement of the efficacy of the laser through increase of the power output to a maximum of 80 W and eventually 120 W, the encouraging clinical achievements resulted in a growing popularity of the laser system application. Swiss medical centres have been significantly involved in the evaluation of the clinical adoption of this surgical technique. Particularly the low peri- and post-operative morbidity as well as promising short- to medium-term functional results are noteworthy.In the present paper we present major results of the clinical evaluation of the technique. In addition to the important advantages of the technique, especially the virtually bloodless procedure, we also highlight the drawbacks and limitations of laser vaporisation, which possibly might entail adverse clinical effects.

Therefore, adjuvant immunotherapy may have a better impact on clinical outcome. In this phase II clinical trial, we aimed to test the feasibility of using a specific mutant ras peptide vaccine as an adjuvant immunotherapy in pancreatic and colorectal cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with no evidence of disease (NED), five pancreatic and seven colorectal cancer patients were vaccinated subcutaneously with 13-mer mutant ras peptide, corresponding to their tumor's ras mutation. Vaccinations were given every 4 weeks, up to a total of six vaccines. RESULTS: No serious acute or delayed systemic side effects were seen. We detected specific immune responses to the relevant mutant ras peptide by measuring IFN-gamma mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR. Five out of eleven patients showed a positive immune response. Furthermore, the five pancreatic cancer patients have shown a mean disease-free survival (DFS) of 35.2+ months and a mean overall survival (OS) of 44.4+ months. The seven colorectal cancer patients have shown a mean disease-free survival (DFS) of 27.2+ months and a mean overall survival (OS) of 41.5+ months. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that it is feasible to use mutant ras vaccine in the adjuvant setting.

The goal of treating patients with localized prostate cancer is a curative one and includes minimizing adverse effects to preserve an adequate quality of life. Better understanding on how the quality of life is affected depending on the treatment modality would assist patients in deciding which treatment to choose; furthermore, the development of prognostic biomarkers that indicate the future course of the illness is a promising approach with potential and the focus of much attention. These questions can be addressed in the context of a cohort study. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, multi-center cohort study within the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. We will include patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer independently of treatment finally chosen. We will acquire clinical data including quality of life and lifestyle, prostate tissue specimen as well as further biological samples (blood and urine) before, during and after treatment for setup of a bio-bank. Assessment of these data and samples in the follow up will be done during routine controls. Study duration will be at least ten years. Influence of treatment on morbidity and mortality, including changes in quality of life, will be identified and an evaluation of biomarkers will be performed.

A substantial proportion of patients are at risk for recurrence because no effective adjuvant therapy exists. We investigated the use of an autologous, tumour-derived heat-shock protein (glycoprotein 96)-peptide complex (HSPPC-96; vitespen) as adjuvant treatment in patients at high risk of recurrence after resection of locally advanced renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: In this open-label trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either vitespen (n=409) or observation alone (n=409) after nephrectomy. Randomisation was done in a one to one ratio by a computer-generated pseudo-random number generator, with a block size of four, and was stratified by performance score, lymph node status, and nuclear grade. Vitespen was given intradermally once a week for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks until vaccine depletion. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival. The final analysis of recurrence-free survival was planned to take place after 214 or more events of disease recurrence or deaths before recurrence had occurred. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00033904. FINDINGS: 48 patients in the vitespen group and 42 in the observation group were excluded from the ITT population because they did not meet post-surgery inclusion criteria; the ITT population thus consisted of 361 patients in the vitespen group and 367 in the observation group. Final analysis of recurrence-free survival was triggered in November, 2005. Re-review of all patients in the ITT population by the clinical events committee identified 149 actual recurrences (73 in the vitespen group and 76 in the observation group), nine deaths before recurrence (two in the vitespen group and seven in the observation group), and 124 patients with baseline metastatic or residual disease (61 in the vitespen group and 63 in the observation group). Thus, after a median follow-up of 1.9 years (IQR 0.9-2.5) in the ITT population, recurrence events were reported in 136 (37.7%) patients in the vitespen group and 146 (39.8%) in the observation group (hazard ratio 0.923, 95% CI 0.729-1.169; p=0.506). After continued follow-up until March, 2007, there had been 70 deaths in the vitespen group and 72 in the observation group (p=0.896); however, overall survival data were not mature, and patients continue to be followed up for survival. In predefined exploratory analyses by AJCC stage, recurrence events in patients with stage I or II disease were reported in 19 (15.2%) patients in the vitespen group and 31 (27.0%) in the observation group (hazard ratio 0.576, 95% CI 0.324-1.023; p=0.056). The most commonly reported adverse events in the vitespen group were injection-site erythema (n=158) and injection-site induration (n=153). One serious adverse event-autoimmune thyroiditis of grade 2 severity-was reported in the vitespen group; no treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported.

Hypoxic preconditioning stabilizes the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 in the retina and strongly protects photoreceptors in an animal model of light-induced retinal degeneration. To address the molecular mechanisms of the protection, we analyzed the transcriptome of the hypoxic retina using  microarrays and real-time PCR.\r\nResults: Hypoxic exposure induced a marked alteration in the retinal transcriptome with significantly different expression levels of 431 genes immediately after hypoxic exposure.

The strongly upregulated cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was excluded from being essential for neuroprotection. \r\nConclusion: Our data suggest that neuroprotection after hypoxic  reconditioning is the result of the differential expression of a multitude of genes which may act in concert to protect visual cells against a toxic insult."], "publisher": ["BioMed Central"], "date": ["2008-02-08"], "source": ["Thiersch, M; Raffelsberger, W; Frigg, E; Samardzija, M; Wenzel, A; Poch, O; Grimm, C  (2008).

A disturbance in osmohomeostasis may be one causative factor for the alterations in the inner retina. Because M\u00fcller cells mediate inner retinal osmohomeostasis (mainly through channel-mediated transport of potassium ions and water), the authors investigated whether these cells alter their properties in response to excessive blue light. METHODS: Retinas of adult rats were exposed to blue light for 30 minutes. At various time periods after treatment, retinal slices were immunostained against glial fibrillary acidic protein and potassium and water channel proteins (Kir4.1, aquaporin-1, aquaporin-4). Patch-clamp recordings of potassium currents were made in isolated M\u00fcller cells, and the swelling of M\u00fcller cell bodies was recorded in retinal slices. RESULTS: After blue light treatment, M\u00fcller cells displayed hypertrophy and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein. The immunostaining of the glial water channel aquaporin-4 was increased in the outer retina, whereas the immunostaining of the photoreceptor water channel aquaporin-1 disappeared. Blue light treatment resulted in a decrease and a dislocation of the Kir4.1 protein in the whole retinal tissue and a decrease in the potassium conductance of M\u00fcller cells. Hypo-osmotic stress evoked a swelling of M\u00fcller cell bodies in light-treated retinas that was not observed in control tissues.

METHODS: A 1-year prospective Swiss study, including all newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients. Information on circumstances of HIV infection was collected through physician- and patient questionnaires and patient interviews. Information on timing of infection was linked with an HIV-antibody avidity assay. RESULTS: Of 710 newly HIV diagnosed patients, 543 (76%) physician questionnaires (PhyQ) and 145 (20%) patient questionnaires (PaQ) were returned. PhyQ required fewer reminders (57% vs 28% spontaneous return). Patients whose doctors had returned the PhyQ were comparable to total population group. In contrast, a strong bias towards well educated recently infected Swiss men having sex with men (MSM) was seen in patients returning PaQ or agreeing to an interview. 83% of patients claimed that they knew the infection source and 85% infection place. Unprotected sexual contact was the most frequently cited infection source (92%; n = 404). Men mainly claimed occasional (43%) and women steady (61%) partners as the most likely source of HIVinfection. Serum for timing of infection was available in 98% of patients. Recent infections (RI) were highest in MSM (51%) and intravenous drug users (IDU, 54%). Compared to women, heterosexual men were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with a RI.

METHODS: Treatment-naive HIV-1-infected individuals (n=198) from the Mupfure Schistosomiasis and HIV Cohort were followed until death or censoring (3-4.3 years). At baseline, p24, HIV-RNA, CD4 cell counts, and clinical staging (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification) were assessed. RESULTS: p24 correlated with HIV-RNA (P<0.0001, R: 0.44). Ten percent of p24 but only 1% of HIV-RNA measurements was undetectable. p24 predicted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category (P<0.001) stronger than CD4 count (P=0.34) in multivariate logistic regression. p24 predicted mortality in univariate Cox analysis (P<0.0001) and in multivariate analysis, but it was inferior to HIV-RNA and CD4 count.

We aimed to identify predictors for the emergence of K65R, using clinical data and genotypic resistance tests from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. METHODS: A total of 222 patients with genotypic resistance tests performed while receiving treatment with TDF-containing regimens were stratified by detectability of K65R (K65R group, 42 patients; undetected K65R group, 180 patients). Patient characteristics at start of that treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: In an adjusted logistic regression, TDF treatment with nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and/or didanosine was associated with the emergence of K65R, whereas the presence of any of the thymidine analogue mutations D67N, K70R, T215F, or K219E/Q was protective. The previously undescribed mutational pattern K65R/G190S/Y181C was observed in 6 of 21 patients treated with efavirenz and TDF. Salvage therapy after TDF treatment was started for 36 patients with K65R and for 118 patients from the wild-type group. Proportions of patients attaining human immunodeficiency virus type 1 loads <50 copies/mL after 24 weeks of continuous treatment were similar for the K65R group (44.1%; 95% confidence interval, 27.2%-62.1%) and the wild-type group (51.9%; 95% confidence interval, 42.0%-61.6%). CONCLUSIONS: In settings where thymidine analogue mutations are less likely to be present, such as at start of first-line therapy or after extended treatment interruptions, combinations of TDF with other K65R-inducing components or with efavirenz or nevirapine may carry an enhanced risk of the emergence of K65R.
