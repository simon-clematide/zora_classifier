They represent footprints of ancient retroviral infection and are vertically transmitted from parents to their offspring. In the genome of all domestic cats, sequences closely related to exogenous FeLV known as endogenous feline leukemia virus (enFeLV), are present. enFeLV are incapable of giving rise to infectious virus particles. However, transcription and translation of enFeLV have been demonstrated in tissues of healthy cats and in feline cell lines. The presence of enFeLV-env has been shown in specific embryonic tissues and adult thymic cells. In addition, the enFeLV-env region recombines with FeLV subgroup A giving rise to an infectious FeLV-B virus. enFeLV envelope protein, FeLIX (FeLV infectivity X-essory protein) is also involved in mediating FeLV-T infection. In order to test the hypothesis that the enFeLV loads play a role in exogenous FeLV-A infection and pathogenesis, quantitative real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays were developed. An assay, specific to U3 region of all different subtypes of exogenous FeLV, was designed and applied to quantify exogenous FeLV proviral or viral load in cats, while three real-time PCR assays were designed to quantify U3 and env enFeLV loads (two within U3 amplifying different sequences; one within env). enFeLV loads were investigated in blood samples derived from Swiss privately owned domestic cats, specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats and European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris). Significant differences in enFeLV loads were observed between privately owned cats and SPF cats as well as among SPF cats originating from different catteries and among domestic cats of different breeds. When privately owned cats were compared, FeLV-infected cats had higher loads than uninfected cats. In addition, wildcats had higher enFeLV loads than domestic cats. In conclusion, the quantitative real-time PCR assays described herein are important prerequisites to quantify enFeLV proviral loads in felids and thus are important tools to investigate the role of enFeLV loads in FeLV infection."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["2008"], "source": ["Tandon, R; Cattori, V; Willi, Barbara; Lutz, H; Hofmann-Lehmann, R  (2008).

To address this hypothesis and expand the PCR-based knowledge on canine hemoplasmosis, we investigated dogs in a climatic zone that does not allow for the permanent establishment of R. sanguineus. Blood samples were collected throughout a year from 889 dogs in Switzerland: 1.2% of the dogs tested real-time PCR positive.

METHODS: CCK-8 uptake was measured in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the organic anion-transporting polypeptides of rat liver (Oatp1, Oatp2, Oatp3, or Oatp4) and of human liver (OATP-A, OATP-B, OATP-C, or OATP8) and in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. RESULTS: Rat Oatp4 and human OATP8 efficiently mediated CCK-8 uptake in oocytes, with Michaelis constant (Km) values of 14.9 +/- 2.9 micromol/L and 11.1 +/- 2.9 micromol/L, respectively. CCK-8 uptake by hepatocytes was also saturable, with a Km of 6.7 +/- 2.1 micromol/L. The Km value in rat hepatocytes is consistent with Oatp4-mediated transport. CONCLUSIONS: CCK-8 is selectively transported by rat Oatp4 and human OATP8, both of which are exclusively expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes.

Recently, a high-affinity digoxin transporter (Oatp2) was cloned from rat brain and shown to be also expressed in the liver. METHODS: We investigated the cellular and subcellular distribution of Oatp2 in rat liver by in situ hybridization technology and immunofluorescence microscopy and compared its substrate specificity with that of Oatp1 in complementary RNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes. RESULTS: The results show a selective basolateral (sinusoidal) expression of Oatp2 in midzonal to perivenous hepatocytes, but not in periportal or the innermost layer of perivenous hepatocytes. Common substrates of both Oatp1 and Oatp2 include bile salts, steroid conjugates, thyroid hormones (T3, T4), ouabain, and the endothelin receptor antagonist BQ-123 (Michaelis constants: Oatp1, approximately 600 micromol/L; Oatp2, approximately 30 micromol/L). Other organic anions including sulfolithotaurocholate, bilirubin monoglucuronide, and sulfobromophthalein were transported only by Oatp1. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide definite evidence for the partially overlapping and partially selective substrate specificities of Oatp1 and Oatp2. The unique acinar distribution of Oatp2 might indicate that it represents a high-affinity \"backup\" system for complete hepatocellular removal of certain cholephilic substances from portal blood plasma."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["1999"], "source": ["Reichel, C; Gao, B; Van Montfoort, J; Cattori, V; Rahner, C; Hagenbuch, B; Stieger, B; Kamisako, T; Meier, P J  (1999).

So far, most FeLV pathogenesis and vaccine studies were conducted assaying parameters, such as virus isolation and antigen detection. Accordingly, regressive infection was characterized by transient or undetectable viremia, while persistent viremia is typically observed in cats with progressive infection. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, the spectrum of host response categories to FeLV infection was recently refined by investigating proviral and plasma viral RNA loads. Cats believed to be immune to FeLV infection were found to turn provirus-positive after virus exposure. Moreover, efficacious FeLV vaccines were found unable to prevent provirus-integration and minimal viral replication. Remarkably, no difference was found in initial proviral and plasma viral RNA loads between cats with different infection outcomes. Only subsequently, the infection outcome is associated with FeLV loads. FeLV provirus was found to persist for years; reoccurrence of viremia and disease development was observed in some cats. Thus, aviremic provirus-positive cats are FeLV carriers and, following reactivation, may act as an infection source. However, integrated viral DNA may also be essential for solid protection and long-lasting maintenance of protective immunity. In conclusion, real-time TaqMan PCR and RT-PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific. They yield a more sensitive measure for FeLV exposure than antigen detection, virus isolation or immunofluoresence assays.

Originally known as Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon species, these organisms have been reclassified within the genus Mycoplasma. The development of new molecular assays has expanded our knowledge of this heterogeneous group of agents and allowed us to study their epidemiology and pathogenesis. The present review summarizes recently gained insights into feline hemotropic mycoplasmas, formerly known as Haemobartonella felis. Besides the two initially identified feline hemoplasma species, Mycoplasma haemofelis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum, we discovered a third novel hemoplasma in a Swiss pet cat; preliminary results suggest that the pathogenic potential of the latter agent depends on cofactors. In applying PCR-based assays, feline hemoplasma infections have been documented in domestic cats and wild felids worldwide. Differences between the three hemoplasmas in regard to response to antibiotic treatment and establishment of a carrier status have been reported. Additionally, besides an ostensible vector-borne transmission, direct transmission by aggressive interaction of cats or interspecies transmission might play a role in the epidemiology of these organisms. Based on a potential vector-borne and interspecies transmission, a zoonotic potential of hemoplasmas should be further investigated."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["2007"], "source": ["Willi, Barbara; Boretti, Felicitas S; Tasker, S; Meli, Marina L; Wengi, N; Reusch, Claudia E; Lutz, H; Hofmann-Lehmann, R  (2007).
