A sample of 90 consecutive Caucasian patients (aged 33-88 years), treated with at least one ITI-implant participated in this retrospective investigation. Standardized periapical radiographs were taken after prosthetic rehabilitation (133.6 days, SD 136.9 days) and at the time of the re-examination, on average 5.6 years (SD 2.5 years) thereafter. The radiographs were analyzed by a calibrated examiner for changes in peri-implant bone levels. The examiner was blind with respect to clinical parameters and IL-1 status. The distance between the implant shoulder and the first visible bone-implant contact (DIB) at the respective time points were measured using a computerized method. The absolute bone level difference during the years of service (ABL) and the annual bone loss (DeltaBL/year) were calculated for all the implants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients who received 112 hollow screw implants (HS) of the ITI Dental Implant System were divided into two groups: group A - eight patients with 21 implants having lost their teeth due to chronic periodontitis; group B - forty five patients with 91 implants without a history of periodontitis. One and 10 years after surgical placement, clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed. The incidences of peri-implantitis were noticed over the 10 years of regular supportive periodontal therapy. RESULTS: Success criteria at 10 years were set at: pocket probing depth (PPD) <or=5 mm, bleeding on probing (BoP-, bone loss <0.2 mm annually. The survival rate for the group with a past history of chronic periodontitis (group A) was 90.5%, while for the group with no past history of periodontitis (group B) it was 96.5%. Group A had a significantly higher incidence of peri-implantitis than group B (28.6% vs. 5.8%). With the success criteria set, 52.4% in group A and 79.1% of the implants in group B were successful. With a threshold set at PPD <or=6 mm, BoP- and bone loss <0.2 mm annually, the success rates were elevated to 62% and 81.3% for groups A and B, respectively.

Theoretically, tractional forces in all synovial joints are the result of frictional forces, due to rubbing of the cartilage surfaces, and plowing forces, due to translation of the stress-field through the cartilage matrix as the joint surface congruency changes during motion. For plowing forces to occur in the TMJ, there must be mediolateral translation of the stress-field as the condyle moves dorsoventrally during jaw function. To test whether mediolateral stress-field translation occurs in the intact TMJ, we measured stress-field position and translation velocities in ten normal individuals during rhythmic jaw opening and closing. Magnetic resonance imaging and jaw tracking were combined to animate the three-dimensional position of the stress-field between the articulating surfaces. This allowed for mediolateral translation velocity measurements of the centroid of the stress-field. The results showed that during jaw opening and closing at 0.5 Hz, the average peak mediolateral translation velocity was 35 +/- 17 mm/sec. When opening and closing increased to 1.0 Hz, the average peak velocity was 40 +/- 19 mm/sec.

The dorsoventral disc position was diagnosed by means of the sagittal scans. The mediolateral disc width and position were then measured on every oblique-axial scan.

Finally, a statistical analysis was performed to study whether the disc width and the direction of the disc midline varied between discs normally positioned and anteriorly displaced. RESULTS: The disc width varied significantly more within the anteriorly displaced discs than within the normal ones. The midline of the anteriorly displaced discs deviated more from the perpendicular to the condylar long axis than that of normally positioned discs and was mostly in a lateral direction.

The action screw formulation is verified using in vivo motion data and MR image information for a single asymptomatic subject. The results confirm the feasibility of the method and its application in dental research. A general increase in the mechanical advantage of most muscles, in the distance between action and motion screws as well as in the expended energy towards the end of the jaw-closing phase was observed.

This is possible by the combination of three-dimensional reconstructions of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) anatomy with jaw motion recordings. This technique allows us to analyze the variation of the relationship between the articular surfaces, providing indirect insight into disk deformation during function and parafunction as well as TMJ loading. As far as the variation of the condyle-fossa distance is concerned, data indicated that during chewing the distance was smaller 1) on closing than on opening; 2) on the balancing than on the working side; and 3) during chewing of hard than soft food. Moreover, during a forceful static biting, the condyle-fossa distance decreased more on the contralateral, i.e. on the balancing side than on the working side. The decrease was related to the degree of clenching force. These results support the content that both condyles are loaded during chewing and the balancing side joint more than the working one. Biomechanically, the development of osteoarthrosis is more likely related to the magnitude and frequency of stresses applied on the cartilage. Joint movements produce tractional forces that may cause shear stresses contributing to cartilage wear and fatigue. Tractional forces are the result of frictional forces caused by the cartilage surface rubbing and of plowing forces caused by the translation of a stress-field through the cartilage matrix, as the intra-articular space changes during motion. Translation of the stress-field in mediolateral direction seems to be particularly important for the integrity of the TMJ disk because of its anisotropic properties. Dynamic stereometry showed that stress-fields translate in mediolateral direction during opening/closing, protrusion and laterotrusion, and that their translatory velocity varies intraindividually and with the rate of the condylar movement. Furthermore, the results seem to indicate that the lateral area of the TMJ disk is more often exposed to shear stresses caused by stress-field translation than the medial one. In conclusion, dynamic stereometry provides a good visualization of the movement of the condyles in the respective fossae. This helps improving our understanding for the complexity of condylar movements.

The complaint of burning mouth is fairly common. Epidemiological studies suggest a prevalence of around 15% in postmenopausal women and between 0,7 and 7,9% for the general population. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to present a review of the literature on epidemiology, clinical symptoms, etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of burning mouth and burning mouth syndrome. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. Potential causal factors have been extensively studied and reviewed, suggesting a multifactorial aetiology, that apparently includes local, systemic and psychogenic factors. However, reports of their relative importance are conflicting.Consequently this lack of evidence is reflected in inconsistent guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. Most of the authors emphasize the importance of history taking and clinical intraoral examination for diagnosis. The symptom of burning mouth associated with clinical mucosal abnormality has to be differentiated from burning mouth syndrome (BMS), a condition in which no mucosal abnormality is evident on examination.Whereas the symptom of burning mouth associated with clinical mucosal signs is described to be often manageable by eliminating possible causal factors, the background of most of the proposed treatments for BMS is empiric or even purely anecdotal. Only a few randomised controlled studies have been performed on treatment outcome.

Vor allem leichte bis m\u00e4\u00dfig starke myoarthropathische Schmerzen haben die Tendenz, spontan zu verschwinden.

Its diagnosis is not always easy because the diagnostic signs are not pathognomonic and they may occur also with other pain disorders. The pain intensity fluctuates, and mild to medium intensity pain has the tendency to subside spontaneously or can be alleviated with simple, non-invasive therapies such as counseling, self-control, analgesics, physiotherapy, and occlusal appliances. For most patients a combination of counseling, self-control and physiotherapy (home program) is sufficient to relieve the pain. Occlusal appliances should, therefore, be used only if these modalities fail or if pain is present on awakening. Only in a small percentage of patients the myoarthropathic pain persists and becomes chronic. The factors that determine pain chronicity are complex and most likely due to the interaction of biomedical factors - such as the persistence of peripheral nociceptive input, neuroplastic changes at spinal and supraspinal levels (cortical reorganisation)- with psychosocial factors, in addition, possibly, to a polymorphism of the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene. Patients with chronic myogenic pain need a multimodal therapy, according to the biopsychosocial pain model. In addition to the modalities just described, the treatment must address also the affective, emotional, cognitive and behavioural pain component and be tailored to the single patient based on his/her psychosocial and constitutional characteristics. The goal is not pain relief but improvement of the quality of life by teaching the patient more efficient pain coping strategies by means of behavioural and relaxation techniques. In addition, tricyclic antidepressants may be used in order to treat the somatic pain component caused by the neuroplastic changes that take place in the central nervous system in chronic pain conditions."], "publisher": ["Springer"], "date": ["2003-12-01"], "source": ["Palla, S  (2003).

A survey of the literature showed that only 23 of 69 selected cases qualified under the criteria of Meyer and Shklar. REPORT OF A CASE: A 48-year-old white male suffering from a previously operated lung carcinoma was referred due to pain and discomfort in the left TMJ. A solitary condylar metastasis of the mandible was revealed. Because of diffuse tumorous infiltration into periarticular tissue, irradiation treatment was performed. During the long-term follow-up growth of additional skeletal metastases occurred. DISCUSSION: The course of condylar metastases in general is similar to other metastases involving the jaw. Breast cancer as the primary tumor is most frequent, followed by lung cancer. There are no specific clinical or radiological parameters leading to diagnosis. The clinician should take a potential metastasis into account when dealing with TMJ complaints, radiological oddities, and medical history of malignant tumors.

To date, classification is confusing due to a non-uniform terminology. The aim of this study was to establish a simple (clinical) classification based on patient data from our clinic. METHODS: Retrospective analysis revealed 30 cases of which clinical course, radiology, pathology, therapy and outcome were analysed. RESULTS: Both sexes were equally represented. The mean age at onset of disease was 35 years (range 5-76 years). Onset of disease revealed two peaks of incidence, one in adolescence and one after age 50 years. While clinical symptoms were similar in all cases, an increased intensity of these symptoms was noted in younger individuals as well as in the early stages of the disease. Five adults and one adolescent presented with additional non facial bone, joint and skin manifestations consistent with the diagnosis of SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis) syndrome, or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. Radiology demonstrated sclerosis, osteolysis and periosteal reaction in variable stages in all cases. However, findings were more extensive in younger patients. Histology revealed different stages of chronic inflammation in all cases. Microabscess formation was noted in 11 cases, six of which were children/adolescents.Therapy consisted mainly of surgery, antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.At the end of the follow up period, 11 patients demonstrated complete remission, while in 14 cases amelioration and in 5 no significant improvement was noted. CONCLUSION: Based on differences in age at presentation, clinical appearance and course, radiology and histology, a subclassification into early and adult onset primary chronic osteomyelitis has been established.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study had local ethical committee approval, and all patients gave written informed consent. Thirty-four consecutive patients (17 men, 17 women; mean age, 64.2 years; age range, 46.0-84.6 years) who were clinically suspected of having bone invasion from oral cavity carcinoma prospectively underwent helical contrast-enhanced CT, coregistered PET/CT, and coregistered SPECT/CT. Two radiologists assessed the contrast-enhanced CT images and two nuclear medicine physicians separately assessed the PET/CT and SPECT/CT images in consensus and without knowledge of the results of other imaging tests. The presence of bone involvement as suggested with an imaging modality was compared with histologic findings in the surgical specimen. RESULTS: With histologic findings as the standard of reference, the accuracy of SPECT/CT (88% [30 of 34 patients]) was lower than that of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT (94% [32 of 34 patients] and 97% [33 of 34 patients], respectively).

The current techniques include implantation of autologous fat, bone or muscle. These techniques are effective when the appropriate guidelines are respected, but the problems of donor site morbidity, which has been as high as 5%, recipient site morbidity due to the shrinkage of the free graft, and the increase in the operative time must be pointed out.

Enamel surface alterations after laser irradiation were monitored using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Laser irradiation through the fluoride solution led to significantly higher fluoride contents in the surface enamel layer compared to fluoride treatment alone or laser treatment alone (p=0.002). Laser treatment with or without fluoride resulted in an increased acid resistance of enamel specimens.

In this report, stable folding variants of the natural occurring osteoinductive BMPs were shown to act as inhibitors for heterotopic ossification. The most effective BMP folding variant construct performed even better than the natural occurring BMP antagonist Noggin because it also inhibited calcium deposition of pre-osteoblastic cells. INTRODUCTION: Signal transduction through receptor and ligand binding depends on the proper folding of all partners, especially when it involves the formation of a heterotetramer. In the case, the receptor binding of the ligand can be uncoupled from signal transduction, and folding variants of a ligand can be developed into antagonists of the natural bioactivity of the ligand. Here we present a deletion mutant of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) folding variant capable of inhibiting the bone-inducing action of natural occurring BMPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deletion mutants and site-directed mutants of BMP folding variants were generated and tested for their ability to reduce alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization in a pre-osteoblastic cell line. In vivo activity of the optimized folding variant was determined in a heterotopic ossification model in rodents and in two Xenopus laevis model systems. Biosensor interaction analysis was used to determine the affinity of the optimized BMP folding variant to the extracellular domain of BMP receptors. RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo tests in rodents revealed that the structural elements of the wrist epitope combined with finger 2 and a positive charge proximal to the tip of this finger are sufficient to induce osteoinhibition with deletion mutants and folding variants of mature BMP-4. The inhibitor designed to suppress heterotopic ossification showed BMP antagonist activity in embryos and animal caps of X. laevis. Binding studies of the inhibitor to ectodomains of type I and type II BMP receptors revealed a concentration-dependent binding, especially to the high-affinity BMP receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion mutants of BMP folding variants are a new form of BMP antagonists and act through competition with osteoinductive BMP for BMP receptor binding. The excellent in vivo performance of the optimized folding variant is because of its ability to block signaling of endogenous BMPs deposited in the extracellular matrix even more effectively than the natural occurring BMP antagonist Noggin."], "publisher": ["American Society for Bone and Mineral Research"], "date": ["2003-12-01"], "source": ["Weber, Franz E; Schm\u00f6kel, H; Oelgeschl\u00e4ger, M; Nickel, J; Maly, F E; Hortschansky, P; Gr\u00e4tz, K W  (2003).

PURPOSE: This study compared 2 soft tissue augmentation surgeries commonly used to alter contours of single-tooth pontic space by quantifying 3-dimensional volume changes with the optical projection Moir\u00e9 method at 1 and 3.5 months after surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients required surgery. Each patient had a localized alveolar ridge defect, corresponding to a mesial-distal width of 1 single tooth. The defect of 12 patients was corrected with a subepithelial connective tissue graft; the remaining 12 patients were treated by receiving a free full-thickness gingival graft, which included epithelium and connective tissue with fatty tissue. Six unoperated defects of 6 patients formed the control group. For each defect, an impression was made before treatment, at 1 and 3.5 months after surgery to measure the volume changes on the dental casts with a validated projection Moir\u00e9 system. Volume change was assessed relative to the preoperative dimension at the buccal and crestal aspects of the single-tooth pontic space. RESULTS: At 3.5 months postsurgery, mean volumetric gain for the connective tissue group with 159 mm(3) (SD +/- 80) was significantly greater (P =.027) than for free full-thickness gingival graft group with 104 mm(3) (SD +/- 31). CONCLUSION: The applied projection Moir\u00e9 method proved its applicability in assessing 3-dimensional volume changes of pontic spaces with a single-tooth width.

During surgery, data were gathered concerning failure of the osteosynthesis material. Clinical examination was carried out weekly until the sixth postoperative week. Cephalometric analysis of standardized cephalograms was performed to evaluate the short-term skeletal stability pattern, which was compared with similar reports in the literature. Six weeks postoperatively, all jaws were clinically stable and there was no clinical evidence of foreign body reactions. For the whole group (n = 10), the mean maxillary advancement at point A was 2.9 mm with a mean postoperative relapse of 0.0 mm. The mean advancement at point B was 2.8 mm with a mean additional advancement postoperatively of 1.1 mm. The mean vertical surgical displacement at point A was directed inferiorly with a value of 1.8 mm and a relapse of -0.4 mm. At point B the corresponding values were 1.9 mm and -0.4 mm. In the Angle Class III group (n = 4), the mean advancement at A was 5.9 mm with an additional postoperative advancement of 0.3 mm.

The control group consisted of 106 patients with similar pathology who were examined by computed tomography without a headholder. The application of the craniostat resulted in the following advantageous findings: (1) reproducible CT scans, therefore very precise assessment of the course of a disease; (2) fewer motion artifacts; and (3) symmetrical posture of the patient's head.

The pain curve under mefenamine acid showed a significant increase during the first 48 hours after extraction. With rofecoxib a continuous pain decrease with the lowest stand 48 hours after intervention was registered. One week after extraction the patient's satisfaction was in favour of rofecoxib, which showed a clearly prolonged analgetic effect over 24 hours.

These vascular lesions are difficult to treat, frequently recur, and can cause patients significant morbidity. Treatment may also be complicated by adjacent vital anatomic structures. Magnetic resonance (MR)-controlled laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) has been proven to be a noninvasive safe treatment. Real-time monitoring of tissue temperature with thermosensitive sequences allows controlled coagulation necrosis. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: LITT was performed in a lymphangioma specimen ex vivo. In four patients (eight procedures) with lymphangiomas of the tongue and neck, MR-guided LITT was performed with a percutaneous approach in a multiapplicator technique. The laser system consisted of a titanium catheter and a protective catheter. The dome of the fiber end had a diameter of 1.4 mm with an active length of 20 mm. Temperature sensitive sequences were used in a 0.5 T open-configured MR scanner with the proton frequency shift technique to map the spatial and temporal distribution of Nd:YAG laser effects (7 Watts, 30 pulses per second, 10 minutes/location). Postoperative MR follow-up was performed at 1 week and at 3 months. In three patients, partial resection of the tumor was performed 6 months after LITT. RESULTS: In three patients, MR clearly showed a diminished tumor volume. All four patients reported subjective amelioration and in three patients former functional problems, such as speech and swallowing were improved. MR thermometry allowed accurate demarcation of changes by heat and distinction of affected tumor volume (3.0 cm +/- 0.3 cm). The histology of the patients 6 months after LITT showed laser-induced fibrosis of former lymphatic tissue. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that LITT can be performed safely with tissue preserving of vital structures and can be effective in the treatment of deep tumors, such as lymphangiomas.

In spite of this feedback between cell activity and growth factor mobilization in the extracellular matrix, this approach has not been extensively explored in therapeutic situations. We present an engineered bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) fusion protein that mimics such function in a surgically relevant matrix, fibrin, incorporated into the matrix until it is locally liberated by cell surface-associated proteases. A tripartite fusion protein, denoted TG-pl-BMP-2, was designed and produced recombinantly. An N-terminal transglutaminase substrate (TG) domain provides covalent attachment to fibrin during coagulation under the influence of the blood transglutaminase factor XIIIa. A central plasmin substrate (pl) domain provides a cleavage site for local release of the attached growth factor from the fibrin matrix under the influence of cell-activated plasmin. A C-terminal human BMP-2 domain provides osteogenic activity. TG-pl-BMP-2 in fibrin was evaluated in vivo in critical-size craniotomy defects in rats, where it induced 76% more defect healing with bone at 3 weeks with a dose of 1 mug/defect than wildtype BMP-2 in fibrin. After a dosing study in rabbits, the engineered growth factor in fibrin was evaluated in a prospective clinical study for pancarpal fusion in dogs, where it induced statistically faster and more extensive bone bridging than equivalent treatment with cancellous bone autograft.

PATIENTS: Twenty-six patients suffering from ameloblastoma had been collected. Five of them, had a maxillary ameloblastoma, three females and two males. METHODS: A clinical retrospective study was performed. In addition a review of the literature was undertaken and the findings have been compared and contrasted. PATIENTS: The overall incidence of ameloblastoma within the mandible (21) was four times higher than in the maxilla (5). In 69 per cent of the cases (18) it occurred in men, in 31 percent (8) in women. The sex ratio differed with the maxillary ameloblastomas: 40 percent male (2) and 60 per cent female (3). Although slow growing and nearly painless, it can reach a considerable size within the mid-face involving such highly specialized structures as the orbit, skull-base and brain. Wide resections with a safety margin of healthy bone to prevent local recurrence were undertaken. Nevertheless, recurrence was frequent due to invasion of the adjacent bone. CONCLUSION: On the one hand, a recurrence was found after a simple curettage of a 'dental cyst'. On the other hand, extensive bone destruction, involvement of the nasal cavity, the ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses, infiltration of the skull-base and distant metastasis were observed. The current treatment of choice is partial maxillectomy with a 10-15 mm safety margin of healthy bone including the alveolar ridge, the hard palate, the mucosa of the maxillary sinus and the lateral nasal wall.

On the basis of repeated examinations, the present report describes the influence of gingival inflammation on the initiation of periodontitis from 16 to 59 years of age. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data originated from a 26-year longitudinal study of Norwegian males, who practiced daily oral home care and received state-of-the-art dental care. The initial examination included 565 individuals. Subsequent examinations took place in 1971, 1973, 1975, 1981, 1988 and 1995. Thus, the study covers the age range of 16-59 years. All tooth sites were divided into four categories according to their history of gingival inflammation over the entire observation period: sites always scoring GI = 0, GI = 1 and GI = 2 sites (GI = gingival index). Sites disclosing various GI scores at different observation periods were not considered. RESULTS: The mean cumulative attachment loss for non-inflamed (GI = 0) sites in individuals approaching 60 years of age was 1.94 mm. Sites always scoring GI = 1 yielded 2.42 mm, and sites that always scored GI = 2 exhibited 3.31 mm of periodontal attachment loss. At interproximal sites of all three groups where gingival trauma was assumed to be minimal or non-existent, only very few sites expressed attachment loss due to gingival recession (2-4%). At interproximal sites always scoring GI = 0, 20% loss of attachment was in the form of pocket formation by 59 years of age. The GI = 1 and the GI = 2 cohorts exhibited attachment loss with pocket formation in 28% and 54%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that, as men approach 60 years of age, gingival sites that throughout the 26 years of observation bled on probing had approximately 70% more attachment loss than sites that were consistently non-inflamed (GI = 0). Before 40 years of age, there was a slight increase in periodontal attachment loss due to pocket formation, but after this, the frequency increased significantly. Loss of attachment due to gingival recession was very small in all three groups.The fact that sites with non-inflamed gingiva also exhibited some loss of attachment and pocket formation may be explained by fluctuation in the variations of tissue status during long observation intervals combined with the presence of subclinical inflammation."], "publisher": ["Wiley-Blackwell"], "date": ["2003-10-01"], "source": ["Sch\u00e4tzle, M; L\u00f6e, H; B\u00fcrgin, W; Anerud, A; Boysen, H; Lang, N P  (2003).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 26-year longitudinal investigation of the initiation and progression of chronic periodontitis that started in 1969 and included 565 men of Norwegian middle class, 223 who had participated in some, but not all, intermediate examinations presented at the last survey in 1995. Fifty-four individuals were available for examination in all seven surveys. RESULTS: Covering the age range from 16 to 60 years, the study showed that at 16 years of age, 5% of the participants had initial loss of periodontal attachment (ILA > or = 2 mm) at one or more sites. Both the subject incidence and the site incidence increased with time, and by 32 years of age, all individuals had one or more sites with loss of attachment. As age progressed, new lesions affected sites, so that as these men approached 60 years of age approximately 50% of all available sites had ILA. An assessment of the intraoral distribution of the first periodontal lesion showed that, regardless of age, molars and bicuspids were most often affected. At and before the age of 40 years, the majority of ILA was found in buccal surfaces in the form of gingival recession. By 50 years, however, a greater proportion of sites presented with attachment loss attributed to pocket formation or a combination of pocket formation and gingival recession. As individuals neared 60 years of age, approximately half of the interproximal areas in posterior teeth had these lesions. CONCLUSION: This investigation has shown that, in a well-maintained population who practises oral home care and has regular check-ups, the incidence of incipient periodontal destruction increases with age, the highest rate occurs between 50 and 60 years, and gingival recession is the predominant lesion before 40 years, while periodontal pocketing is the principal mode of destruction between 50 and 60 years of age."], "publisher": ["Wiley-Blackwell"], "date": ["2003-10-01"], "source": ["Heitz-Mayfield, L J A; Sch\u00e4tzle, M; L\u00f6e, H; B\u00fcrgin, W; Anerud, A; Boysen, H; Lang, N P  (2003).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data originated from a 26-year longitudinal study of Norwegian males who had received regular and adequate dental care and practised daily oral home care. The initial examination in 1969 included 565 individuals aged between 16 and 34 years. Subsequent examinations took place in 1971, 1973, 1975, 1981, 1988 and 1995. Thus, the study covers the age range of 16-59 years. The rate of the annual attachment loss was calculated as the difference between the individual mean attachment loss between two examinations divided by the years between examinations. The mean annualized relative risk of attachment loss was calculated as the frequency distribution of sites with initial periodontal attachment loss (loss of attachment at the first time of occurrence > or = 2 mm) and healthy sites (loss of attachment always < 2 mm). For comparison of significant changes in annual attachment loss rates between the age groups and mean annualized relative risks of attachment loss as they proceeded through adult life, the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U-test was used. RESULTS: The mean overall individual attachment loss during 44 years (between 16 and 59 years) totaled 2.44 mm (range 0.14-2.44 mm), averaging an annual mean rate of 0.05 mm/year. The highest annual rate of attachment loss occurred before 35 years of age (0.08-0.1 mm/year), after which the mean annual rate decreased to about 0.04-0.06 mm/year for the next three decades of life leading to 60 years. The mean annualized relative risk of initial attachment loss increased significantly from adolescence (1.2%) to the maximum at 30-34 years of age (6.9%). After the age of 34 years, the risk of initial attachment loss decreased again, but after the age of 40 years, another continuous increase was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Over a 26-year period, 25% of the subjects went through adult life with healthy and stable periodontal conditions. The remaining 75% developed slight to moderately progressing periodontal disease with progression rates varying between 0.02 and 0.1 mm/year with a cumulative mean of loss of attachment of 2.44 mm as they approached 60 years of age. The annual mean rate and the mean annualized risk of initial attachment loss were highest between 16 and 34 years of age. Only 20% of the sites continued to lose further attachment during the remainder of the observation period, and less than 1% of the sites showed substantial loss of attachment (> 4 mm)."], "publisher": ["Wiley-Blackwell"], "date": ["2003-10-01"], "source": ["Sch\u00e4tzle, M; L\u00f6e, H; Lang, N P; Heitz-Mayfield, L J A; B\u00fcrgin, W; Anerud, A; Boysen, H  (2003).

Thus, the study covers the age range of 16-59 years. The teeth were divided into three tooth groups (I-III) reflecting the history of inflammation of the surrounding gingiva (gingival index (GI) scores) over 26 years: (I) teeth with surrounding gingival units scoring a minimum of one site with GI=0 and a maximum of three sites with GI=1, (II) teeth with surrounding gingival units scoring a minimum of one site with GI=1 and a maximum of three sites with GI=2 over the observation periods and (III) teeth with surrounding gingival units always scoring a minimum of GI=2 (bleeding on probing) at all sites over the observation period. RESULTS: At baseline (1969), out of possible 15,820 teeth (565 x 28), 15,383 teeth were present. Four hundred and thirty-seven teeth had already been missing for unknown reasons. By 1995, 13,159 teeth were reexamined, i.e. over the 26-year observation period only 126 (0.95%) teeth were lost. Only 16 (0.28%) of 5793 teeth belonging to GI-Severity Group I were lost. In the GI-Severity Group II, however, 78 (2.28%) out of 3348 teeth were lost, and 13 (11.21%) of 103 teeth with GI-Severity Group III were lost. Teeth with GI-Severity Group III yielded an odds ratio for tooth loss that was 46 times higher than that of teeth with GI-Severity Group I, and five times higher than that of teeth with GI-Severity Group II over 26 years. Furthermore, teeth with the GI-Severity Group II had a nine times higher risk for tooth loss than teeth with the GI-Severity Group I. The GI-Severity Group I retained 99.5% of the teeth after a tooth age of 51 years. The GI-Severity Group II retained 93.8% of the teeth after a tooth age of 50 years. However, in the GI-Severity Group III, 63.4% of the teeth were retained for a tooth age of 47 years. CONCLUSIONS: Teeth surrounded with inflammation-free gingival tissues were maintained for a tooth age of 51 years, while teeth consistently surrounded with inflamed gingivae yielded a 46-times higher risk to be lost.

The high-dose irradiated animals were given in the TMJ 22.4 Gy/4 fractions irradiation (equivalent to 50 Gy/25 fractions). Low-dose irradiation group received a 2.2 Gy dosage. Two groups were also given preoperatively HBO 18 x 2.5ATA x 90 min. After a two-week distraction period (14 mm lengthening) and four-week consolidation period the TMJs were removed. Proteoglycan (PG) distribution of the extracellular matrix was evaluated using safranin O staining and collagen I and II using immunohistochemistry. The organization of fibrillar network was studied by polarized light microscopy. On the operated side of the control group and on the unoperated side in all, except for high-dose irradiated group, PG distribution and fibrillar network were normal appearing. In the irradiated groups, with or without HBO, the cartilaginous layer was partially or totally devoid of PG and the network structure was severely damaged.

The causes of root resorption may vary, leading to several types of resorptions. Some factors have been identified and may be categorized into physiological resorption, local factors, systemic conditions, and idiopathic resorptions. The objective of this report was to present a case of a 17-year-old white female with progressive, generalized, apical idiopathic root resorption followed up for 34 months. METHODS: Two panoramic radiographs, 14 and 34 months after initial clinical and radiological examinations, showed the rapid progression of apical root resorption. Two molars, teeth #15 and #16, which had to be extracted, and a bone sample from the distal aspect of tooth #15 were processed for histologic analysis. RESULTS: Two millimeters apical to the cemento-enamel junction, an abrupt increase in the cementum thickness was noted, amounting to 300 and 800 microm in teeth #15 and #16, respectively. The thickening of the cementum layer was due to an accelerated deposition of cellular intrinsic fiber cementum. An unusually high number of mineralization foci were observed in association with acellular extrinsic fiber cementum, and both free and fused cementicles were seen. In contrast to tooth #16, tooth #15 revealed extensive dentin replacement by a bone-like and a cementum-like tissue. Furthermore, ankylosis was demonstrated in tooth #15 and confirmed in the bone sample. CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no preventive or therapeutic regimen for the type of root resorption seen in this case report.

Eugenol-based sealers are used during root canal treatment in teeth that may require build-ups or extensive restorations. Unfortunately, the adverse effect of eugenol has mostly been assessed in shear bond tests and this variable may be clinically inappropriate. The current study evaluate the effect of eugenol in a eugenol-based endodontic sealer on marginal adaptation of composite resin restorations with and without thermo-mechanical stress. METHODOLOGY: Thirty Class V cavities with half of the cavity margins in dentine and half of the cavity margins in enamel were prepared in extracted human premolars and then divided into 5 groups. Teeth in group 1 were not contaminated with eugenol. Cavities in groups 2-4 were contaminated with a eugenol-based sealer (Tubli-Seal, Kerr) and cleaned with: (i) sandblasting, (ii) bur finishing alone or (iii) bur finishing combined with swabbing with alcohol. These 4 groups were temporized for 6 weeks (Ketac, ESPE), whilst group 5 received no eugenol, was not temporized and acted as the control. Cavities were restored with Tetric Ceram using Syntac Classic (Vivadent) as a dentine-bonding agent. The specimens were then thermo-mechanically stressed. The percentages of marginal adaptation in dentinal and enamel margins were assessed in a SEM at x200 magnification before and after stress using a replica method. Mean percentages of marginal adaptation were calculated and compared using a two way-ANOVA (influence of eugenol and cleaning procedure) and non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Marginal adaptation in enamel exceeded 95% and 92% in all specimens before and after thermo-mechanical stress, respectively. Before stress, marginal adaptation in dentine ranged from 92.3 +/- 7.9% to 95.7 +/- 6.2% in groups 1-5. After stress, the percentage of marginal adaptation in dentine decreased significantly overall (P < 0.05, range 39.8 +/- 21.1% to 82.9 +/- 13.7%). The effect of contamination with eugenol was not significant (P > 0.05): in contrast, there was a significantly beneficial effect when the entire cavity was finished with burs (P < 0.01).

First, the shapes and sizes of palatal cusps of non-erupted human upper third molars were measured. The cusp cupola was best described by the formula y = 0.001 x2 and was symmetrical around the axis of rotation. Up to 200 microm of the y-axis, this parabola corresponded best to a ball radius of 0.6 mm. Based on this information, standardized antagonists were fabricated from both human enamel and steatite. Wear in the occlusal contact area and the wear of opposing conventional ceramic and fine hybrid composite, respectively, were quantified in a computerized chewing simulator. As a control, natural human enamel cusps were used. Standardization of enamel cusps did not reduce the variation of the resulting wear compared with that of non-standardized enamel antagonists.

PURPOSE: This in vitro study examined the influence of cavity design and operative technique on the marginal adaptation of resin-bonded composite FPDs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Slot-inlay tooth preparations with cavity margins located in enamel were prepared in 18 maxillary canines and 18 maxillary first molars designated as abutments. The specimens were divided equally into 3 experimental groups. In all groups, butt joint tooth preparations were created in canines and molars. In group 2, canines were prepared additionally with a 1.5-mm wide palatal bevel in enamel. After pretests with modification spaces of 11 and 17 mm (length), 2 missing premolars were replaced by the ceromer Targis and reinforced with the glass-fiber material Vectris. The prostheses were inserted with Tetric Ceram with use of an ultrasonic-supported, high-viscosity technique. Restorations were selectively bonded to cavity finish lines in groups 1 and 2 (\"selective bonding\"). In group 3, restorations were bonded totally to the whole cavity surface (\"total bonding\"). The restorations were stressed in a computer-controlled masticator. Marginal quality was examined with an SEM at x 200. RESULTS: The percent area of optimal margins after thermomechanical loading between composite and enamel in each group was as follows: group 1, 86.2% +/- 12.3% for canines and 95.5% +/- 3.5% for molars; group 2, 95.3% +/- 2.1% for canines and 96.2% +/- 2.7% for molars; and group 3, 95% +/- 0.9% for canines and 86.4% +/- 3.2% for molars. The marginal quality for molars inserted with total bonding was significantly lower (P< or =.05).

Recently, it was shown that peri-implant crestal bone changes differ significantly under such conditions and are dependent on a rough/smooth implant border in 1-piece implants and on the location of an interface (microgap) between the implant and abutment/restoration in 2-piece configurations. Several factors may influence the resultant level of the crestal bone under these conditions, including movements between implant components and the size of the microgap (interface) between the implant and abutment. However, no data are available on the impact of possible movements between these components or the impact of the size of the microgap (interface). The purpose of this study was to histometrically evaluate crestal bone changes around unloaded, 2-piece non-submerged titanium implants with 3 different microgap (interface) dimensions and between implants with components welded together or held together by a transocclusal screw. METHODS: A total of 60 titanium implants were randomly placed in edentulous mandibular areas of 5 hounds forming 6 different implant subgroups (A through F). In general, all implants had a relatively smooth, machined suprabony portion 1 mm long, as well as a rough, sandblasted, and acid-etched (SLA) endosseous portion, all placed with their interface (microgap) 1 mm above the bone crest level and having abutments connected at the time of first-stage surgery. Implant types A, B, and C had a microgap of < 10 microns, approximately 50 microns, or approximately 100 microns between implant components as did types D, E, and F, respectively. As a major difference, however, abutments and implants of types A, B, and C were laser-welded together, not allowing for any movements between components, as opposed to types D, E, and F, where abutments and implants were held together by abutment screws. Three months after implant placement, all animals were sacrificed. Non-decalcified histology was analyzed histometrically by evaluating peri-implant crestal bone changes. RESULTS: For implants in the laser-welded group (A, B, and C), mean crestal bone levels were located at a distance from the interface (IF; microgap) to the first bone-to-implant contact (fBIC) of 1.06 +/- 0.46 mm (standard deviation) for type A, 1.28 +/- 0.47 mm for type B, and 1.17 +/- 0.51 mm for type C. All implants of the non-welded group (D, E, and F) had significantly increased amounts of crestal bone loss, with 1.72 +/- 0.49 mm for type D (P < 0.01 compared to type A), 1.71 +/- 0.43 mm for type E (P < 0.02 compared to type B), and 1.65 +/- 0.37 mm for type F (P < 0.01 compared to type C). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate, as evaluated by non-decalcified histology under unloaded conditions in the canine mandible, that crestal bone changes around 2-piece, non-submerged titanium implants are significantly influenced by possible movements between implants and abutments, but not by the size of the microgap (interface). Thus, significant crestal bone loss occurs in 2-piece implant configurations even with the smallest-sized microgaps (< 10 microns) in combination with possible movements between implant components."], "publisher": ["American Academy of Periodontology"], "date": ["2001-10-01"], "source": ["Hermann, J S; Schoolfield, J D; Schenk, R K; Buser, D; Cochran, D L  (2001).

Thus, the celluloid strip-finished composite surface may not cure enough compared with the polished composite surface. PURPOSE: This study tested the hypothesis that the celluloid strip-finished composite surface did not cure enough compared with the polished composite surface. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The composite was placed in a 1.5-mm thick aluminum mold and the upper surface was covered with a celluloid strip. Composite was light cured for 60 seconds, then a layer of approximately 200 microm thick was ground away from the lower surface and polished. The hardness of the upper composite surface that was polymerized under a celluloid strip and the polished lower surface were measured with Vickers hardness measuring instrument 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 6 days after light curing. The hardnesses of polished and celluloid strip-finished surfaces were compared using a paired t test. One-way ANOVA and Tukey was used for tests for the significant differences in hardnesses between 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 6 days after light curing for a given surface. RESULTS: Microhardness of the celluloid strip-finished composite surface was 380.6 N/mm(2) at 15 minutes, 442.5 N/mm(2) at 6 hours, and 519.2 N/mm(2) at 6 days after light curing.

Considering these facts the present study presents a concept of investigating light curing units. In a further study all light curing units available on the Swiss market will be investigated using this protocol. Newly released light curing units should be investigated in this manner to actualize the existing results. Initially specifications and features are summarised using a questionnaire. Several tests are performed to investigate the parameters of the units. The light intensity emitted from the curing tip is analysed by the radiant power, the radiance and the light distribution across the face of the light curing tip as a function of time. Precise radiometers and a camera for picture processing are used for these measurements. Density filters are used to reduce the radiant power. The measurements of the precise radiometer are compared with those of the integrated radiometer of the light-curing unit. In this way the precision of integrated radiometers is controlled at maximum and reduced output. For evaluating the presence and the quality of integrated voltage stabilizer, the line voltage is varied from 230 V down to 207 V and up to 244 V and the radiant power is measured. The integrated timer is measured for its accuracy in each unit. The time intervals are controlled using a stopwatch. Finally the cooling device is tested.

Als Grundlage diente das im ersten Teil dieser Publikation ver\u00f6ffentlichte Pr\u00fcfungsprotokoll (11/1999). Die Ausr\u00fcstungsmerkmale variierten von Ger\u00e4tetyp zu Ger\u00e4tetyp. Das Ger\u00e4t Optilux 500 bot alle nur erdenklichen Features, sodass es im Bereich Ausr\u00fcstung als Massstab dienen k\u00f6nnte. Ob all diese m\u00f6glichen technischen Optionen notwendig sind, sei dem einzelnen Benutzer \u00fcberlassen. Als wichtige Komponenten k\u00f6nnen jedoch Timer, Radiometer und Spannungsstabilisator angesehen werden, da sie die Faktoren Bestrahlungszeit und -intensit\u00e4t mit beeinflussen k\u00f6nnen. Der Strahlungsfluss in Milliwatt bzw. die Strahlungsflussdichte in Milliwatt pro cm2 wurden in zwei f\u00fcr die Polymerisation wichtigen Wellenl\u00e4ngenbereichen gemessen. Die absoluten Werte mit Standardlichtleiter und bei 230 V lagen zwischen 143,4 mW und 389,7 mW im Wellenl\u00e4ngenbereich von 400 bis 520 nm und zwischen 17,7 mW und 41,8 mW im Wellenl\u00e4ngenbereich von 462 bis 472 nm. Die daraus resultierenden spezifischen Leistungen variierten zwischen 268,3 mW/cm2 und 862,6 mW/cm2 im breiten Spektrum von 400 bis 520 nm und zwischen 33,5 mW/cm2 und 95,4 mW/cm2 im schmalen Spektrum von 462 bis 472 nm. Wurden die Standardlichtleiter durch Lichtleiter mit anderen Durchmessern ersetzt, so zeigten Lichtleiter mit gr\u00f6sserem Eintrittsfenster die gr\u00f6ssere absolute Leistung, Lichleiter mit kleinerem Austrittsfenster die gr\u00f6ssere spezifische Leistung. Turbolichtleiter haben gr\u00f6ssere Ein- als Austrittsfenster und vereinten somit beide positiven Effekte in sich.

Charakteristisch war eine kegelf\u00f6rmige Verteilung mit maximaler Intensi\u00e4t im Zentrum, die mit zunehmendem Radius abnahm. Entsprechend den spezifischen Leistungswerten zeigten Lichtleiter mit abnehmendem Durchmesser auch homogenere Verteilungsmuster. Nur Turbolichtleiter zeigten schlechtere Verteilungsdiagramme. Wurde die Lichtleistung bei einer Prim\u00e4rspannung von 207 V und 244 V gemessen und mit der Lichtleistung bei 230 V verglichen, zeigte sich, dass nicht alle Ger\u00e4te einen Stabilisator der Sekund\u00e4rspannung eingebaut hatten. Nur 9 der 16 getesteten Ger\u00e4te verf\u00fcgten \u00fcber einen integrierten Radiometer.

The basis of this study was the test protocol published in the november edition (11/1999). The features of the light curing units differed from one another. The Optilux 500 had all conceivable features that it could be designated the standard in features. If all these technical options are necessary has to be decided by the consumer. However, the components such as the timer, radiometer and voltage stabilizer are important because they influence the time of irradiation and the radiant power. The radiant power (mW) i.e., the radiance (mW/cm2) were measured in 2 spectral areas which are important for visible light polymerisation. The absolute values for the standard curing tip at a voltage of 230 V lay between 143.4 and 389.7 mW for the wavelengths between 400-520 nm and between 17.7 and 41.8 mW for the wavelengths between 462-472 nm. The resultant specific radiance values were between 268.3 and 862.6 mW/cm2 in the broad spectrum of 400-520 nm and 33.5 and 95.4 mW/cm2 in the narrow spectrum of 462-472 nm. Where the standard curing tips were replaced by guides with other diameters, tips with larger entrances showed more radiant power, light guides with smaller exits also showed more radiance. Turbo tips have larger entrances than exits and therefore combine both positive effects. The intensity wasn't distributed equally across the face of the curing light guide. Characteristically there was a concentric distribution of the intensity, with the maximum found in the centre and a decrease to the margin. Corresponding to the radiance values, curing light tips with decreasing diameters showed more homogeneous distribution patterns. Only Turbo tips showed worse distribution. Comparing the light intensity at a voltage of 207 V and 244 V to the normal voltage of 230 V it was found that not all curing units had an integrated voltage stabilizer. Just 9 out of the 16 tested units had an integrated radiometer. Comparison of the evaluated radiance values to the values given by the integrated radiometer revealed an agreement in just two cases. The marginal values, programmed by the manufacturer varied between 70 and 300 mw/cm2 and lie therefore, too low."], "publisher": ["Schweizerische Zahn\u00e4rzte-Gesellschft"], "date": ["1999-12"], "source": ["Thormann, J; Lutz, F  (1999).

Physikalische Parameter bei der rotierenden Kanalaufbereitung am gekr\u00fcmmten Wurzelkanal sind nur ungen\u00fcgend untersucht. Daher war es das Ziel des hier dargestellten Projektes, einen Versuchsaufbau f\u00fcr solche Messungen zu entwickeln. Dies wurde durch die Konstruktion eines Messaufbaus verwirklicht, bei dem ein Drehmomentaufnehmer zwischen dem Kanalinstrument und der Motorwelle integriert ist. Durch weitere Sensoren kann die apikale Kraft sowie die Eindringtiefe des Instrumentes relativ zur Zeit bestimmt werden. Durch spezielle Anbauteile liessen sich auch weitere Messm\u00f6glichkeiten verwirklichen. In der hier dargestellten ersten Versuchsreihe wurden GTInstrumente der Gr\u00f6ssen 35.12 sowie 20.12 bis 20.06 untersucht. Neben den Parametern \u00abFrakturmoment nach ISO 3630-1\u00bb und \u00abZyklen bis zum Erm\u00fcdungsbruch am Phantom\u00bb wurde auch die Pr\u00e4paration von gekr\u00fcmmten simulierten Wurzelkan\u00e4len in Plastikbl\u00f6cken untersucht.

Dagegen lag die Zahl der Rotationen bei einer Kanalaufbereitung weit unter den am Phantom mit einem Kr\u00fcmmungsradius von 5 mm ermittelten. Insofern erscheint eine Anwendung eines GT-Instrumentensatzes in 10 Kan\u00e4len m\u00f6glich.

These instruments enable clinicians to prepare better shaped root canals, however, rotary instruments have a higher risk for fracture than hand instruments. Unfortunately, the stresses placed on engine-driven rotary instruments in curved canals are insufficiently studied. The aim of this study was to develop a device which could measure more accurately the physical parameters influencing rotary instruments in curved canals. For this purpose, a specially designed machine was constructed to measure the torque which develops between the rotary instrument and the motor. Apical forces and penetration depths could also be directly measured in real time. A variety of other measurements was also possible because of other special set-ups integrated into the device. In the current study torque was assessed for GT-Files, size 35 with a .12 and sizes 20 with a .12 to .06 taper. In additions to preparations in simulated canals in plastic blocks, the \"ISO 3630-1 specification for fracture moment\" and \"number of cycles till fatigue fracture\" was measured. The findings indicated that when instruments were used for preparations, torques up to 40 Nmm were present. This exceeded the static fracture load, which was less than than 13 Nmm for the size 20 with .12 taper. In contrast, the number of rotations were more than 10 times lower when shaping canals in plastic blocks with a 5 mm radius of curvature than the number of rotations to fracture in the \"cyclic fatigue test\". This suggests that a GT-instrument could be used in ten canals. The apical force was always greater than 1 N and occasionally, 8 N or more was recorded. Further studies on natural teeth with varying canal geometries are required using the specially developed torsional machine to reduce the incidence of instrument fracture.

METHODS: Thirty-six extracted non-carious human molars were demineralized in a defined approximal area of interest (AOI) using a gel system (pH 4.8) applied over 15 weeks. Standardized digital radiographs were taken before and after creation of caries-like lesions and grayscale values were measured within the AOI. For another group of eight teeth, artificial defects were mechanically induced by a diamond bur and densitometric analysis was performed. Statistical significance was tested using the Wilcoxon test and set at p < or = 0.05. In addition, radiographs were interpreted by visual examination by six experienced dentists. The sensitivity and specificity for both study groups were determined in comparison to a baseline group of untreated teeth. Polarized light microscopy and SEM analysis were used to evaluate changes in the subsurface mineralization pattern and surface micromorphology. RESULTS: Densitometric comparison of images from identical regions in control teeth revealed no significant grayscale value differences within the AOI, whereas a significant decrease (p < or = 0.05) was observed in the demineralized group. Mechanically induced lesions also showed a significant densitometric decrease (p < or = 0.05). The sensitivity of visual inspection of radiographs of demineralized areas was 0%. In contrast, the sensitivity for the detection of a mechanical defect of 0.1mm, which was the same subsurface extension as the histologically determined demineralization, increased to 52%. Specificity was 100% for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: CADIA is able to detect very small changes in mineralization of incipient carious approximal lesions in vitro.

Subsequently, teeth were randomly assigned to receive a 10 mL rinse of aqueous 17% (w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or tap water for 2 or 10 min, followed by a final rinse with a 2% Patent Blue dye solution for 2 or 10 min (eight groups, n = 10 teeth per group).

The intention is to give any interested clinician a better idea of the technique using radiographs taken from both the buccolingual (clinical) perspective and the mesiodistal projection. Basically, the technique involves preparing the coronal portion of the root canal using Gates-Glidden burs and the ProFile instruments. Only when any constricting coronal parts of the canals have been removed is the working length established using conventional files.

Bacterial samples were collected from the deepest site in each quadrant, resulting in a total of 264 sites with a mean probing pocket depth of 6.6 +/- 1.5 mm. Samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media, and isolates were characterized to species level. Indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies was applied to detect Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (Bacteroides forsythus, Tannerella forsythensis), Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces israelii. RESULTS: 93.6% of sampled sites showed bleeding on probing and 23.5% were positive for suppuration. P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, and C. rectus were detected in 77.3-85.9% of samples using culture methods and in 85.6-91.3% using immunofluorescence.

STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen diseased mesial roots of mandibular first molars were treated endodontically, each in one visit. Mesio-buccal canals were instrumented using stainless steel hand files and mesio-lingual canals with a nickel-titanium rotary system. The canals were irrigated with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) during the instrumentation procedures, rinsed with 10 mL of 17% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and obturated with gutta-percha and zinc oxide eugenol cement.

After the laser drilling, the occlusal cavities were closed temporarily, and the teeth were extracted 7 days (n=5) and 3 months (n=2) after the operation. The specimens were fixed, decalcified, subdivided and processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. Seven days postoperatively all the five teeth that had been irradiated with the CO2 laser did not reveal any pathological changes in the pulpo-dentine complex. Three months postoperatively the two teeth that were prepared with the laser showed subtle but distinct apposition of tertiary dentine that was lined with intact odontoblasts. One of the specimens at 3 months revealed the presence of a mild, but very circumscribed, pulpal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells subjacent to the cavity preparation. The latter is unlikely to be due to a direct effect of the laser irradiation but a possible consequence of microleakage of oral antigens and/or other tissue-irritating molecules through the temporary restoration and the remaining dentine thickness (RDT). Although these preliminary histological results suggest that the CO2 laser under investigation induced only minimal response of the dentine-pulp complex when used as a hard-tissue drilling tool, with specific energy settings, pulse duration within thermal relaxation time and emitting radiations at 9.6 microm of wavelength, larger clinical trials involving various types of teeth are necessary to reach definite conclusions for large-scale clinical application of the laser device."], "publisher": ["Springer"], "date": ["2005"], "source": ["Nair, P N R; Baltensperger, M M; Luder, H U; Eyrich, G K H  (2005).

Persistent apical periodontitis occurs when root canal treatment of apical periodontitis has not adequately eliminated intraradicular infection. Problems that lead to persistent apical periodontitis include: inadequate aseptic control, poor access cavity design, missed canals, inadequate instrumentation, debridement and leaking temporary or permanent restorations. Even when the most stringent procedures are followed, apical periodontitis may still persist as asymptomatic radiolucencies, because of the complexity of the root canal system formed by the main and accessory canals, their ramifications and anastomoses where residual infection can persist. Further, there are extraradicular factors -- located within the inflamed periapical tissue -- that can interfere with post-treatment healing of apical periodontitis. The causes of apical periodontitis persisting after root canal treatment have not been well characterized. During the 1990s, a series of investigations have shown that there are six biological factors that lead to asymptomatic radiolucencies persisting after root canal treatment. These are: (i) intraradicular infection persisting in the complex apical root canal system; (ii) extraradicular infection, generally in the form of periapical actinomycosis; (iii) extruded root canal filling or other exogenous materials that cause a foreign body reaction; (iv) accumulation of endogenous cholesterol crystals that irritate periapical tissues; (v) true cystic lesions, and (vi) scar tissue healing of the lesion.

The treatment of apical periodontitis, as a disease of root canal infection, consists of eradicating microbes or substantially reducing the microbial load from the root canal and preventing re-infection by orthograde root filling. The treatment has a remarkably high degree of success. Nevertheless, endodontic treatment can fail. Most failures occur when treatment procedures, mostly of a technical nature, have not reached a satisfactory standard for the control and elimination of infection. Even when the highest standards and the most careful procedures are followed, failures still occur. This is because there are root canal regions that cannot be cleaned and obturated with existing equipments, materials, and techniques, and thus, infection can persist.

Three different patterns of initial cementum and dentin lesions could be distinguished, depending on the severity of the cariogenic attack, the degree of sclerosis of the peripheral dentin, and the presence of calculus. Advanced lesions were characterized by various patterns of demineralization. In particular, a massive lateral spread of bacteria into intertubular dentin was observed. Consequently, unaffected dentinal areas became continuously undermined. In arrested lesions, either a partial or complete mineralization of the intertubular dentin was apparent. Dentinal tubules were sclerosed passively by re- or precipitation of Ca and PO4 ions. In contrast, tubules filled with ghosts of bacteria appeared mineralized by fine-granular crystals. Our observations indicate that both the arrestment and the remineralization of active lesions depend on (1) the degree of active sclerosis of dentinal tubules in areas underlying the lesion, (2) the degree of the bacterial infection of the dentin, (3) the degree of progression of the lesions, and (4) the location of the lesions at the various root surfaces.

For epidemiological studies on the prevalence of certain pathogenic clones and transmission of this bacterium, adequate typing methods are necessary. The purpose of this study was to compare six different typing methods for A. actinomycetemcomitans. Five reference strains and 27 fresh clinical isolates from periodontitis patients were used. Serotyping showed 12 serotype a strains, 13 type b strains, 6 type c strains, and 1 nontypeable strain. Biotyping on the basis of the fermentation of mannose, mannitol, and xylose resulted in six biotypes. Antibiogram typing was evaluated by measuring the inhibition zones of seven antibiotics in agar diffusion tests. With this method eight main types which could be further differentiated into 15 subtypes were found. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of outer membrane proteins were similar among all isolates tested. Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of whole chromosomal DNA resulted in five main types. These five main types were further differentiated into 24 subtypes on the basis of DNA fragment differences in the high-molecular-weight region. Hybridization of DNA fragments with ribosomal DNA (ribotyping) resulted in 22 to 24 different types, depending on the restriction endonuclease used. Ribotype patterns were easy to interpret and provided an univocal distinction between different strains compared with REA results. When applied to epidemiologically related isolates, all methods were able to discriminate two clonal types among five isolates from five children from one family. We conclude that serotyping, biotyping, and outer membrane patterns were reproducible but had a low discriminatory potential.

Although recent advances in the field of molecular biology have contributed to an understanding of the involvement of molecular factors in cementum formation during development and regeneration, cementogenesis on a cell biological basis is still poorly understood. Virtually nothing is known about cementoblast origin, differentiation, and the cell dynamics during normal development, repair, and regeneration. This review describes the recent findings of cementogenesis on roots of human premolars and opposes them to those of teeth from other mammals, particularly the rodent molar. METHODS: Using light and electron microscopy, light microscopic radioautography, and various measurements, a comprehensive insight into the development and repair of cementum during and after root formation and tooth eruption has been achieved for human premolars. RESULTS: Cementum is a highly responsive mineralized tissue. This biological activity is necessary for root integrity and for bringing and maintaining the tooth in its proper position. With regard to cementum formation and periodontal fiber attachment, considerable species-particularities exist that are mainly based on differences in growth rates and tooth sizes. Since root development and initial cementogenesis last on the average 5-7 years in human premolars, cementum formation in these teeth is characterized by along-lasting phase of prefunctional development, with occurs independent of principal periodontal fiber attachment to the root and which may take 5 years or more. The first molar of the rat, however, is in functional occlusion 3 1/2 weeks after the onset of root formation. Since initial cementum formation and periodontal fiber attachment to the root occur almost at the same time in this tooth, the distinction between cells associated with one or the other process is very difficult to achieve, and cementogenesis cannot be described independent of periodontal fiber attachment to the root. Therefore, the determination of cementoblast origin in the rodent molar may be intricate. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account these species differences, the current description on the origin and differentiation of cementoblasts is inconsistent and the description of cementogenesis is still incomplete.

On the basis of graphical models, it was hypothesized that the onset of aging conceivably was associated with prominent acceleration in mortality rates. The earliest maximal accelerations in hazard functions for most causes of death occurred during the second and again during the fourth age decade. Overall mortality rates of males and females exhibited prominent humps between the two periods of acceleration. These humps were accounted for largely by a high incidence of deaths from violence (accidents, suicide, and crime), which have to be attributed to environmental factors rather than to senescence. On the other hand, no plausible argument could be found against the assumption that maximal acceleration in death rates from ischemic heart and other circulatory diseases around 20 years of age was related to aging. Therefore, these data were interpreted to indicate that in the population examined, senescent mortality sets in around 20 years of age, about 5 years earlier in males than in females.

Available data on the organization of condylar fibrocartilage are entirely descriptive or have been derived from young adult individuals. In order to examine the variability in normal appearance, condyles from a representative sample of adult humans were analyzed semiquantitatively. METHODS: With a light microscope, features of the superficial, intermediate, and deep tissue zones subjacent to small contiguous sectors of the articular surface were recorded. The distribution of each feature relative to the total surface was then calculated and respective data obtained from nine predetermined condylar regions and from males and females were compared using analysis of variance. RESULTS: The organization of the articular tissue varied significantly in the anteroposterior direction only. Unlike during growth, the superficial and deep zones in anterior and superior regions mostly contained fibrocartilage, although of markedly different appearance. Furthermore, the intermediate zone along about half of its anteroposterior extension lacked a distinctly visible layer, because the cell density was low and there was dense fibrous tissue or fibrocartilage similar to that of the superficial or deep zone, respectively. In these situations, zonation of the articular tissue was revealed only by the arrangement of collagen fibers. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of adult condylar articular tissue, in addition to varying considerably within and between putative load-bearing and nonload-bearing regions, bears only a vague resemblance to the layered organization of the growing condyle.

Rec., 1997;248:18-28), the articular tissue of the adult mandibular condyle was characterized semiquantitatively. However, questions about age changes of mature tissue were not answered, and the time course of tissue maturation from the end of condylar growth to the attainment of the adult appearance remained unknown. These issues are addressed in the present investigation. By using a light microscope, features of the superficial, intermediate, and deep articular tissue zones as well as of the subchondral bone were assessed at nine predetermined condylar sites. The frequencies of these features were recorded as scores from 0 (absent) to 10 (continuous) and were plotted against age. Analysis of covariance served for testing the significance of age and sex effects as well as intracondylar variability. Whereas almost all age-related changes in frequencies of tissue features were similar along the whole lateromedial dimension, changes at the putatively nonload-bearing, posterior slope differed significantly from those at the putatively load-bearing, anterior slope and zenith of the condyle. Two patterns of changes were noted. Frequencies of a first group of tissue features altered mainly during the age period from 15 years to 30 years and remained more or less stable thereafter. This course was characteristic for 1) a progressive cartilaginification of the superficial zone as well as 2) the disappearance of hypertrophic growth cartilage and 3) the appearance of grid-fibrous fibrocartilage in the deep zone, which were accompanied by 4) a decline in endochondral ossification and 5) the formation of a compact, subchondral bone plate. Frequencies of a second group of tissue features disclosed changes that continued up to middle and old age. This pattern was evident regarding 1) a decrease in the prominence associated with 2) a drop in cellularity and 3) progressive fibrosis or even cartilaginification of the intermediate zone. Among the age changes of condylar articular tissue, those affecting the superficial and deep zones as well as the subchondral bone are largely complete by about 30 years of age and seem to be related primarily to a gradual transition from growth to adulthood. In contrast, a second group of alterations, which progress to old age and involve mainly the intermediate zone, appears to be associated with continued maintenance and adaptive articular remodeling as well as possibly senescence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of seven healthy third molars that were to be removed due to space-problem were used. Following the laser excavation, the cavities in dentine were closed temporarily and the teeth were extracted after 7 days (n = 5) and 3 months (n = 2) post-operation. The specimens were fixed, decalcified, subdivided, and processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: In the short-term group, four of the five laser-drilled teeth did not reveal any pathological changes in the pulp-dentine complex. One tooth showed mild disruption of odontoblasts (OB) and vascular dilatation subjacent to the deepest point of the cavity-preparation with a remaining dentine thickness (RDT) of less than 80 microm. The two teeth under long-term observation revealed distinct apposition of tertiary dentine (TD), lined predominantly with cuboidal cells on its pulpal aspect.

In extracted human premolars and molars, clinically sound sites (D0-/D1-lesions), enamel caries (D2-lesions), and dentinal caries (D3-/D4-lesions) were identified using recommended cut-off values. Thereafter, the teeth were cut longitudinally and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy for verification of caries depth. Reproducibility of VI was good, that of EC and LF excellent. In identifying caries at both the enamel and dentin level, the sensitivities of VI and LF were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of EC, while EC was significantly (p < 0.05) more specific. The positive predictive values, however, did not exceed 43%. Improved diagnoses at the dentinal level were obtained, when EC and LF were used as an adjunct to VI and when cut-off values were raised. Thus, visual inspection relying exclusively on fissure discoloration seems to allow only proper identification of sound occlusal surfaces.

In addition we found a highly asymmetric Ag-S bond lengths distribution throughout all complex cations. The stability constants of [Ag](+) with 1 and 2 and, for comparison with [18-aneS6] (5), have been determined in methanol by potentiometric [Ag](+) measurements.

Subtle differences in the coordination properties of these metal ions to RNA, especially to ribozymes, determine whether they either promote or inhibit catalytic activity. The ability of metal ions to coordinate simultaneously with two neighboring phosphate groups is important for ribozyme structure and activity. However, such an interaction has not yet been quantified. Here, we have performed potentiometric pH titrations to determine the acidity constants of the protonated dinucleotide H(2)(pUpU)(-), as well as the binding properties of pUpU(3-) towards Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+), and Pb(2+). Whereas Mg(2+), Mn(2+), and Cd(2+) only bind to the more basic 5'-terminal phosphate group, Pb(2+), and to a certain extent also Zn(2+), show a remarkably enhanced stability of the [M(pUpU)](-) complex. This can be attributed to the formation of a macrochelate by bridging the two phosphate groups within this dinucleotide by these metal ions. Such a macrochelate is also possible in an oligonucleotide, because the basic structural units are the same, despite the difference in charge. The formation degrees of the macrochelated species of [Zn(pUpU)](-) and [Pb(pUpU)](-) amount to around 25 and 90 %, respectively.

In particular, the ability of several nuclides, including 111In, 125I, and 123I, to induce DNA double-strand breaks (dsb), a good indicator of cytotoxicity, has been extensively studied. However, this ability has never previously been shown experimentally for 99mTc, which, besides the well-known gamma radiation that is used for diagnostic applications, also emits an average of 1.1 conversion electrons and 4 Auger or Coster-Kronig electrons per decay. Owing to the short range of Auger electrons, the radionuclide needs to be located very close to the DNA for dsb to occur. We synthesized two cationic 99mTcI-tricarbonyl complexes with pendant DNA binders, pyrene and anthraquinone. The X-ray crystal structures of the two complexes could be elucidated. Linear dichroism and UV/Vis spectroscopy revealed that the complex with pyrene intercalates DNA with a stability constant, K, of 1.1 x 10(6) M(-1), while the analogous complex with anthraquinone interacts with DNA in a groove-binding mode and has an affinity value of K=8.9 x 10(4) M(-1). We showed with phiX174 double-stranded DNA that the corresponding 99mTc complexes induce a significant amount of dsb, whereas non-DNA-binding [TcO4]- and nonradioactive Re compounds did not. These results indicate that the Auger electron emitter 99mTc can induce dsb in DNA when decaying in its direct vicinity and this implies potential for systemic radiotherapy with 99mTc complexes."], "publisher": ["Wiley-Blackwell"], "date": ["2005-02-01"], "source": ["H\u00e4fliger, P; Agorastos, N; Spingler, B; Georgiev, Oleg; Viola, G; Alberto, R  (2005).

The recent discovery that certain transition metal carbonyls function as CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs) in biological systems highlighted the potential of exploiting this and similar classes of compounds as a stratagem to deliver CO for therapeutic purposes. Here we describe the biochemical features and pharmacological actions of a newly identified water-soluble CO releaser (CORM-A1) that, unlike the first prototypic molecule recently described (CORM-3), does not contain a transition metal and liberates CO at a much slower rate under physiological conditions. Using a myoglobin assay and an amperometric CO electrode, we demonstrated that the release of CO from CORM-A1 is both pH- and temperature-dependent with a half-life of approximately 21 min at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. In isolated aortic rings, CORM-A1 promoted a gradual but profound concentration-dependent vasorelaxation over time, which was highly amplified by YC-1 (1 microM) and attenuated by ODQ, a stimulator and inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, respectively. Similarly, administration of CORM-A1 (30 micromol/kg i.v.) in vivo produced a mild decrease in mean arterial pressure, which was markedly potentiated by pretreatment with YC-1 (1.2 micromol/kg i.v.). Interestingly, an inactive form of CORM-A1 that is incapable of releasing CO failed to promote both vasorelaxation and hypotension, thus directly implicating CO as the mediator of the observed pharmacological effects. Our results reveal that the bioactivities exerted by CORM-A1 reflect its intrinsic biochemical behavior of a slow CO releaser, which may be advantageous in the treatment of chronic conditions that require CO to be delivered in a carefully controlled manner."], "publisher": ["Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology"], "date": ["2005-02-01"], "source": ["Motterlini, R; Sawle, P; Hammad, J; Bains, S; Alberto, R; Foresti, R; Green, C J  (2005).

Although in research for at least one decade, only a very few radiopharmaceuticals based on peptides are in clinical use. The difficulty of labeling, and the resulting authenticity of the new vector, is largely responsible for this observation. In this overview, we present an alternate strategy based on the organometallic fac-[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+) core for introducing (99m)Tc in biomolecules in general and in peptides in particular. The three coordination sites available in [(99m)Tc(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+) can be occupied with many different ligand types, pendant to a biomolecule and serving as the anchor group for labeling. This makes the appropriate choice difficult. We intend to present some useful concepts for the practice. Monodentate chelators are robust but bear the risk of multiple binding of biomolecules. Coordinating a bidentate ligand of choice prior to labeling bypasses this problem and enables a systematic drug discovery by variation of the bidentate ligand. Bidentate ligands attached to the biomolecule are stronger but occasionally require protection of the remaining site by a monodentate ligand. Both approaches refer to a mixed-ligand [2+1] approach. Tridentate chelators are the most efficient but need some protecting group chemistry in order to achieve selectivity for the coupling process. Examples with cysteine and histidine are presented.

The variable temperature study has led to the determination of the activation parameters Delta H(++)(ex) = 90 +/- 3 kJ mol(-1), Delta S(++)(ex) = +14 +/- 10 J K(-1) mol(-1), the latter being indicative of a dissociative activation mode for the water exchange process.

The purpose of this study is the coupling of 7 b to amino groups in bioactive molecules such as peptides. After full deprotection of such a bioconjugate, histidine provides three coordination sites which efficiently coordinate to [(99m)Tc(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+) or [Re(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+) in a facial geometry. This allows the development of novel radiopharmaceuticals. Selective derivatization at the N(epsilon) position has conveniently been achieved by concomitant protection of N(alpha) and N(delta) with a carbonyl group forming a six-membered urea. Cyclic urea ring opening with Fm-OH, coupling of phenylalanine as a model to 7 b through its primary amine and removing of all protecting groups in one step gave a histidine derivative of phenylalanine which could be labeled at 10(-5) M with (99m)Tc in very high yield and even in about 50 % yield at 10(-6) M. The Xray structure of a complex with [Re(CO)(3)](+) in which anilin is coupled to 7 b confirms the facial arrangement of histidine. A second pathway applies directly the [Re(CO)(3)](+) moiety as a protecting group. This is one of the rare examples in which a metal fragment is used as a protecting group for organic functionalities. The coordination to histidine protects the N(alpha), N(delta) and COO group in one single step, subsequent alkylation with BrCH(2)COOH(R) at N(epsilon), coupling to phenylalanine and oxidative deprotection of [Re(CO)(3)](+) to [ReO(4)](-) gave the corresponding bioconjugate in which histidine is coupled to phenylalanine through an acetylamide at N(epsilon).

The (99m)Tc-labelling of surfactant would allow to observe its spreading in the lung under clinical conditions. METHODS: [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+) was prepared as described by Alberto et al.

This carbonyl complex was used for the direct labelling of surfactant protein B (SP-B) under non-reductive conditions by direct incubation with SP-B at elevated temperature followed by extraction into CHCl(3)/MeOH. RESULTS: The hydrophobic protein SP-B was labelled with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+). An overall radiochemical yield of about 50% was achieved. HPLC-analysis revealed a single radiolabelled species according to UV elution profile of SP-B, supported by paper and size exclusion chromatography.

NMR experiments gave the first hints of the initial formation of carbene complexes from [Re(NO)2(PR3)2][BAr(F)4] (2 a and 2 b) and norbornene. In a detailed mechanistic study ESI-MS/MS measurements provided further evidence that the carbene formation is initiated by a unique reaction sequence where the cleavage of the strained olefinic bond starts with phosphine migration forming a cyclic ylide-carbene complex, capable of undergoing metathesis with alternating rhenacyclobutane formation and cycloreversion reactions (\"ylide\" route). However, even at an early stage the ROMP propagation route is expected to merge into an \"iminate\" route by attack by the ylide function on one of the N(NO) atoms followed by phosphine oxide elimination.

X-ray crystal structures of all these compounds, except 3a and 3b, are reported. Complex 2a is of particular interest in that it contains the rarer of the two 2-oxo-4-amino tautomer forms of cytosine, namely that with the N3 position protonated. Since the effect of PtII on the geometry of the nucleobase is minimal, bond lengths and angles of CH in 2a reflect, to a first approximation, those of the free rare tautomer. Compared to the preferred 2-oxo-4-amino tautomer (N1 site protonated) of CH, the rare tautomer in 2a differs particularly in internal ring angles (7-11 sigma). Formation of compounds containing the rare CH tautomers on a preparative scale can be achieved by a detour (reaction of PtII with the cytosine anion, followed by cytosine reprotonation) or by linkage isomerization (N3-->N1) under alkaline reaction conditions. Surprisingly, in water and over a wide pH range, N1 linkage isomers (3a, 2a) form in considerably higher amounts than can be expected on the basis of the tautomer equilibrium. This is particularly true for the pH range in which the cytosine is present as a neutral species and implies that complexation of the minor tautomer is considerably promoted. Deprotonation of the rare CH tautomers in 2a occurs with pKa values of 6.07 +/- 0.18 (1 sigma) and 7.09 +/- 0.11 (1 sigma).

CJD is marked primarily by the buildup of misfolded prion protein (PrP(Sc)) in brain, whereas the accrual of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) and tau protein are characteristic for AD. Prior studies have shown that the ATP-binding cassette transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a cellular efflux pump for Abeta, and that age-associated deficits in P-gp may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between P-gp and idiopathic CJD, and found that CJD, like AD, is associated with a decrease in the expression of cerebrovascular P-gp. In some instances, Abeta and PrP deposits coexist in cases of CJD, suggesting the possibility of pathogenic interactions. Since there is, to date, no evidence that PrP itself is a substrate for P-gp, we hypothesize that the age-related deficits in P-gp could promote the accumulation of PrP(Sc) either by promoting the buildup of Abeta (which could act as a seed for the aggregation of PrP(Sc)), or by overloading the ubiquitin-proteasomal catabolic system, and thereby facilitating the accumulation of PrP. Alternatively, the loss of P-gp could be a non-specific response to neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous system. In either case, dysfunction of this critical toxin-elimination pathway in CJD and AD suggests that selectively increasing cerebrovascular P-gp function could open new therapeutic pathways for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of proteopathic disorders of the central nervous system."], "publisher": ["Springer"], "date": ["2006-05-01"], "source": ["Vogelgesang, S; Glatzel, M; Walker, L C; Kroemer, H K; Aguzzi, A; Warzok, R W  (2006).

Changes of the ADC revealed a biphasic function for the evolution of cytotoxic edema during the recovery period. At the end of HI, the ADC in the ipsilateral cortex was significantly decreased. Upon reoxygenation, it returned transiently to normal followed by a secondary, although less pronounced, decline after 8-48 h. After this, the ADC rose steadily. From 8 h of recovery, the proportion of vasogenic edema steadily increased as indicated by the T2 prolongation. At 21 h, the majority of glial cells showed immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein and were of larger size, whereas the neurons were apoptotic.

Although several proteases have been implicated in proteolysis of PrPC, the mechanisms underlying proteolysis of PrPSc remain unclear. Here, it was investigated whether neprilysin, a metalloprotease known to degrade extracellular amyloidogenic proteins such as amyloid-beta, plays a role in prion pathogenesis in vivo. As neprilysin has a broad substrate specificity and is localized subcellularly in the vicinity of PrP, it represents a plausible candidate for prion degradation. Prions were therefore administered to mice lacking or overexpressing neprilysin in brain. However, the gene dosage of neprilysin did not modulate accumulation of PrPSc in brain.

Jakob and H.G. Creutzfeldt, five human diseases have been identified as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). The disease bearing these authors' name, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) occurs sporadically, may be transmitted and has a genetic basis in 10-15% of all cases. Genetic diseases are the Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia. The latest form of CJD in humans, variant CJD (vCJD), was first described in 1996 and may be considered as evidence for a link between human TSEs and those in the animal kingdom. The putative agent of all TSEs is a proteinaceous infectious agent or prion. The gene for the physiological isoform of this protein (prion related protein or PrPc)-is encoded on the short arm of chromosome 20 in humans. The role of the physiological isoform of PrPc is unknown. The physiological isoform PrPc is protease-sensitive and thus designated as PrP-sen, while the pathological isoform is protease-resistant and thus called PrP-res. The pathological isoform PrP-res is invariably associated with TSEs and has given rise to the term prion diseases. PrP-sen and PrP-res have an identical amino acid sequence and have identical posttranslational modifications as assessed by currently available methodology but differ in their tertiary and quaternary structure. These structural differences are thought to be propagated by interaction of PrP-res with PrP-sen, appear to be governed by the polymorphism of PrPc and have been shown to be invariably associated with disease. PrP-sen has a high content of alpha-helical structures, PrP-res consists predominantly of beta-pleated sheets. These physicochemical characteristics of PrP-res cause it to behave like amyloid. The neuropathological hallmarks of TSEs or prion diseases are spongiform change, astrocytic gliosis, neuronal loss and PrP-positive plaques. A nucleic acid has never consistently been shown in any TSE.

Thorough studies of secondary manifestations are therefore pivotal to plan therapeutic approaches for the long-term management of medulloblastoma. Here we describe the incidence of secondary tumour manifestations in 66 patients of a single centre who underwent surgery for medulloblastoma between 1975 and 1990. No patient was excluded due to a poor postoperative course. Thirty-five patients showed evidence of secondary tumour growth. Of these, 17 suffered from local recurrence, and 27 developed metastastatic disease. The median latencies for secondary manifestations were 25 months for local recurrence (n = 17), 11 months for spinal metastases (n = 10), 15 months for supratentorial metastases (n = 8), 8 months for subleptomeningeal dissemination (n = 6), and 23 months for systemic metastases (n = 8). Two patients developed primary metastatic spread to the posterior fossa. Of 8 patients with supratentorial metastases, 6 developed fronto-basal lesions. In our patients, 89% of secondary lesions occurred within less than 3 years after primary diagnosis. 85% of patients with extra-axial tumour spread had been treated with a permanent shunt. Radical tumour resection and radiotherapy with 30 Gy to the neuraxis and 20 Gy boost to the posterior fossa was an important prognostic factor in this series. Patients with additional chemotherapy did not benefit significantly from this treatment. We conclude that optimal management of the primary lesions should aim at (i) total resection, (ii) avoid permanent shunting, and (iii) completion of the radiotherapy with inclusion of the medial frontobasal cisterns in the radiotherapeutic regimen.
