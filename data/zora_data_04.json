As our research focuses on the expression of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in bony fish, we established the technique for IGF-I and IGF-II using the tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as model species. As approach, we used primer extension adding a T7 phage polymerase promoter (21 nt) to the 5' end of the antisense primers. This procedure avoids the disadvantages arising from plasmids. Total RNA extracted from liver was subjected to conventional RT-PCR to create templates for in vitro transcription of IGF-I and IGF-II cRNA. Correct template sizes including the T7 promoter were verified (IGF-I: 91 nt; IGF-II: 94 nt). The PCR products were used to create IGF-I and IGF-II cRNAs which were quantified in dot blot by comparison with defined amounts of standardised kanamycin mRNA. Standardised threshold cycle (Ct) values for IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA were achieved by real-time RT-PCR and used to create standard curves. To allow sample normalisation the standard curve was also established for beta-actin as internal calibrator (template: 86 nt), and validation experiments were performed demonstrating similar amplification efficiencies for target and reference genes. Based on the standard curves, the absolute amounts of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA were determined for liver (IGF-I: 8.90+/-1.90 pg/microg total RNA, IGF-II: 3.59+/-0.98 pg/microg total RNA) and extrahepatic sites, such as heart, kidney, intestine, spleen, gills, gonad, and brain considering the different lengths of cRNAs and mRNAs by correction factors. The reliability of the method was confirmed in additional experiments. The amplification of descending dilutions of cRNA and total liver RNA resulted in parallel slopes of the amplification curves. Furthermore, amplification plots of the standard cRNA and the IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs showed signals starting at the expected Ct values. Thus, the one-tube RT-PCR described here is highly sensitive (detection level approximately 2 pg/microg total RNA) and allows precise absolute quantification. The method is rapid as there are neither separate reverse transcriptions nor post-amplification steps, and can be executed with low risk of contamination. Therefore, it will be helpful when investigating gene expression in any species and tissue whenever absolute levels are of concern."], "publisher": ["Elsevier"], "date": ["2004"], "source": ["Caelers, A; Berishvili, G; Meli, M L; Eppler, E; Reinecke, M  (2004).

Effective transcriptomic profiling of slowly evolving disease processes such as DN can be problematic.

Subsequent gene ontology analysis by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) showed limited detection of biological processes previously identified as central mechanisms in the development of DN (e.g. inflammation and angiogenesis). This apparent lack of sensitivity may be associated with the gene-oriented averaging of oligonucleotide probe signals, as this includes signals from cross-hybridizing probes and gene annotation that is based on out of date genomic data. We then examined the same CEL file data using a different methodology to determine how well it could correlate transcriptomic data with observed biology. ChipInspector (CI) is based on single probe analysis and de novo gene annotation that bypasses probe set definitions. Both methods, RMA and CI, used at default settings yielded comparable numbers of differentially regulated genes. However, when verified by RT-PCR, the single probe based analysis demonstrated reduced background noise with enhanced sensitivity and fewer false positives.\r\nConclusions/Significance: Using a single probe based analysis approach with de novo gene annotation allowed an improved representation of the biological processes linked to the development and progression of DN.

RESULTS: Iatrogenic pulpal wounds treated with MTA were mostly free from inflammation after 1 week and became covered with a compact, hard tissue barrier of steadily increasing length and thickness within 3 months following capping. Control teeth treated with Dycal revealed distinctly less consistent formation of a hard tissue barrier that had numerous tunnel defects. The presence of pulpal inflammation up to the longest observation period (3 months) after capping, was a common feature in Dycal specimens.

Song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) in western North America provide a natural system for examining the genetics of populations that have different patterns of geographic isolation and migratory behavior. We examined the population genetics of 576 song sparrows from 23 populations using seven microsatellite loci to assess genetic differentiation among populations and to estimate the effects of drift and immigration (gene flow) on each population. Sedentary, isolated populations were characterized by low levels of immigration and high levels of genetic drift, whereas those populations less isolated displayed signals of high gene flow and little differentiation from other populations. Contemporary dispersal rates from migratory populations, estimated by assignment test, were higher and occurred over larger distances than dispersal from sedentary populations but were also probably too low to counter the effects of drift \r\nmost populations. We suggest that geographic isolation and limited gene flow facilitated by migratory behavior are responsible for maintaining observed levels of differentiation among Pacific coastal song sparrow populations."], "publisher": ["Nature Publishing Group"], "date": ["2008"], "source": ["Pruett, C L; Arcese, P; Chan, Y L; Wilson, A G; Patten, M A; Keller, L F; Winker, K  (2008).

We examined diversity of nicotinamide dehydrogenase subunit 4 (nad4) mtDNA sequences within and between seven locations: five in the UK (red grouse hosts), one in Iceland (domestic goose) and one in Norway (willow grouse).Within-UK comparisons showed high nucleotide diversity (p = 0.015, n = 23) but no structure between locations (FST = 0.022, P = 0.27), with over 97% of variation distributed within-hosts. The highest diversity was found in Iceland (p = 0.043, n = 4), and the lowest in Norway (p = 0.003, n = 4). Differentiation between countries was considerable (FCT = 0.44, P < 0.05), in spite of the potential mixing effects of gene flow via migrating wild hosts and the poultry trade. However, significant pairwise FST values were found only between Norway and the other locations. Phylogenetic analysis provided statistical support for a separate clade for Norwegian samples only, with unresolved diversity leading to a star-shaped relationship between Icelandic and UK haplotypes. These results suggest that Norwegian T. tenuis are isolated, but that there is some connectivity between UK and Icelandic populations.

The evolution of preferences themselves, on the other hand, depends on genetic variation present in the population. Few models have tracked this feedback between a choice gene and its effects on genetic variation, in particular when genes that determine offspring viability and attractiveness have dominance effects. Here we build a population genetic model that allows comparing the evolution of various choice rules in a single framework. We first consider preferences for good genes and show that focused preferences for homozygotes evolve more easily than broad preferences, which allow heterozygous males high mating success too. This occurs despite better maintenance of genetic diversity in the latter scenario, and we discuss why empirical findings of superior mating success of heterozygous males consequently do not immediately lead to a better understanding of the lek paradox. Our results thus suggest that the mechanisms that help maintain genetic diversity also have a flipside of making female choice an inaccurate means of producing the desired kind of offspring. We then consider preferences for heterozygosity per se, and show that these evolve only under very special conditions. Choice for compatible genotypes can evolve but its selective advantage diminishes quickly due to frequency-dependent selection. Finally, we show that our model reproduces earlier results on selfing, when the female choice strategy produces assortative mating. Overall, our model indicates that various forms of heterozygote-favouring (or variable) female choice pose a problem for the theory of sexual ornamentation based on indirect benefits, rather than a solution."], "publisher": ["Academic Press"], "date": ["2007-01"], "source": ["Lehmann, L; Keller, L F; Kokko, H  (2007).
